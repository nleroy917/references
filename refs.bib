Here we describe our AlphaFold\,3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein--ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein--nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody--antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.},

  abstract = {The core cohesin subunit STAG2 is recurrently mutated in Ewing sarcoma but its biological role is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that cohesin complexes containing STAG2 occupy enhancer and polycomb repressive complex (PRC2)-marked regulatory regions. Genetic suppression of STAG2 leads to a compensatory increase in cohesin-STAG1 complexes, but not in enhancer-rich regions, and results in reprogramming of cis-chromatin interactions. Strikingly, in STAG2 knockout cells the oncogenic genetic program driven by the fusion transcription factor EWS/FLI1 was highly perturbed, in part due to altered enhancer-promoter contacts. Moreover, loss of STAG2 also disrupted PRC2-mediated regulation of gene expression. Combined, these transcriptional changes converged to modulate EWS/FLI1, migratory, and neurodevelopmental programs. Finally, consistent with clinical observations, functional studies revealed that loss of STAG2 enhances the metastatic potential of Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Our findings demonstrate that STAG2 mutations can alter chromatin architecture and transcriptional programs to promote an aggressive cancer phenotype.},

This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as input. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before the classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12\% in the F1 score in the FolhaUOL dataset.

Current annotation methods typically translate accessibility to expression space and rely on gene expression patterns. We propose a novel approach, scATAcat, that leverages characterized bulk ATAC-seq data as prototypes to annotate scATAC-seq data. To mitigate the inherent sparsity of single-cell data, we aggregate cells that belong to the same cluster and create pseudobulk. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we collected a number of datasets with respective annotations to quantify the results and evaluate performance for scATAcat. scATAcat is available as a python package at https://github.com/aybugealtay/scATAcat.},

During the management of these treated patients, a number of clinically important issues arose including which patients might be candidates for combined therapy, which patients require endoscopy for variceal bleeding, and how survival can be predicted during treatment. Our aims were: 1) to identify factors associated with a suboptimal response to UDCA in patients with PBC; 2) to define a simple, non-invasive method to predict those PBC patients most apt to have esophageal varices; and 3) to determine the reliability of the Mayo survival model in predicting the course of UDCA treated patients. Methods: We analyzed the prospectively collected data of 180 patients, who we continue to follow, with PBC who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of UDCA. Results: After six months of UDCA therapy, patients with serum alkaline phosphatase levels less than twice normal (p{$<$}0.04), and/or a Mayo risk score{$<$}4.5 (p{$<$}0.04) were more likely to respond favorably to treatment over a two year period. The Mayo risk score was the single risk factor independently predictive of development of varices (p{$<$}0.01); 93\% of patients who developed varices had a Mayo risk score4. The Mayo survival model, recalculated after 6 months on UDCA therapy accurately predicted patient survival. Conclusions: Suboptimal responders to UDCA can be identified by assessment of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and/or Mayo risk score. A Mayo risk score above 4 helps in selecting patients for endoscopic surveillance for varices and the Mayo survival model accurately predicts the clinical course in patients with PBC receiving UDCA.},

Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%{\textpm}0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

  abstract = {Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a powerful and increasingly popular technique to explore the regulatory landscape of heterogeneous cellular populations. However, the high noise levels, degree of sparsity, and scale of the generated data make its analysis challenging. Here, we present PeakVI, a probabilistic framework that leverages deep neural networks to analyze scATAC-seq data. PeakVI fits an informative latent space that preserves biological heterogeneity while correcting batch effects and accounting for technical effects, such as library size and region-specific biases. In addition, PeakVI provides a technique for identifying differential accessibility at a single-region resolution, which can be used for cell-type annotation as well as identification of key cis-regulatory elements. We use public datasets to demonstrate that PeakVI is scalable, stable, robust to low-quality data, and outperforms current analysis methods on a range of critical analysis tasks. PeakVI is publicly available and implemented in the scvi-tools framework.},

  abstract = {Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, most amino acids can be encoded by multiple synonymous codons. Synonymous codons naturally occur with different frequencies in different organisms. The choice of codons may affect protein expression, structure, and function. Recombinant gene technologies commonly take advantage of the former effect by implementing a technique termed codon optimization, in which codons are replaced with synonymous ones in order to increase protein expression. This technique relies on the accurate knowledge of codon usage frequencies. Accurately quantifying codon usage bias for different organisms is useful not only for codon optimization, but also for evolutionary and translation studies: phylogenetic relations of organisms, and host-pathogen co-evolution relationships, may be explored through their codon usage similarities. Furthermore, codon usage has been shown to affect protein structure and function through interfering with translation kinetics, and cotranslational protein folding.}

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100\,kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer--promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

  abstract = {Most genetic variations associated with human complex traits are located in non-coding genomic regions. Therefore, understanding the genotype-to-phenotype axis requires a comprehensive catalog of functional non-coding genomic elements, most of which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Genome-wide maps of open chromatin regions can facilitate functional analysis of cis- and trans-regulatory elements via their connections with trait-associated sequence variants. Currently, Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is considered the most accessible and cost-effective strategy for genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) technology has also been developed to study cell type-specific chromatin accessibility in tissue samples containing a heterogeneous cellular population. However, due to the intrinsic nature of scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult. To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from preprocessing to downstream analysis, along with an up-to-date list of published studies that involved the application of this method. We expect this review will provide a guideline for successful data generation and analysis methods using appropriate software tools and databases for the study of chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

These regions usually correspond to active regulatory elements and their location profile is unique to a given cell type. When done at single-cell resolution, ATAC-seq provides an insight into the cell-to-cell variability that emerges from otherwise identical DNA sequences by identifying the variability in the genomic location of open chromatin sites in each of the cells. This paper presents Scasat (single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool), a complete pipeline to process scATAC-seq data with simple steps. Scasat treats the data as binary and applies statistical methods that are especially suitable for binary data. The pipeline is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment that holds the executable code along with the necessary description and results. It is robust, flexible, interactive and easy to extend. Within Scasat we developed a novel differential accessibility analysis method based on information gain to identify the peaks that are unique to a cell. The results from Scasat showed that open chromatin locations corresponding to potential regulatory elements can account for cellular heterogeneity and can identify regulatory regions that separates cells from a complex population.},

Contact frequency between functionally validated enhancer-promoter pairs was most enriched near the +1 and +2 nucleosomes at enhancers and target promoters, indicating that functional enhancer-promoter pairs spend time in close physical proximity. Blocking RNA polymerase II (Pol II) caused major disruptions to enhancer-promoter contacts. Paused Pol II occupancy and the enzymatic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) stabilized enhancer-promoter contacts. Based on our findings, we propose an updated model that couples transcriptional dynamics and enhancer-promoter communication.},

Methods PET / MR images from 44 patients with diagnosed adenocarcinoma (24 patients) and squamous cell carcinoma (20 patients) were used for the study. We managed to obtain 155 regions of interest with a size of 128 {\texttimes} 128 pixels, which were used for further analysis. 135 texture parameters were calculated, which were then used for classification using different types of classifiers. Results The best results (75.48 \%) were achieved using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and texture parameters histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) while obtaining the highest values of specificity and sensitivity. The other results of the classification are satisfactory to a large extent. Conclusion The achieved results are satisfactory and give an opportunity to develop and improve the diagnostic process of non-small cell lung tumors at the imaging stage.},

This method is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture, in that chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products. The ligation products contain the information of not only where they originated from in the genomic sequence but also where they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, making it possible to enrich for chimeric DNA ligation junctions when modifying the DNA molecules for deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the power to both explore the chromatin biophysics as well as the implications of chromatin structure in the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies. This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal conditions and in disease.},

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400--800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from\,{$>$}30{\texttimes} average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

Amino acid changes of selected populations are joined with epitopes of interest; a result table summarizes, for each epitope, statistics about the overlapping amino acid changes and about the sequences carrying such alterations. The results may also be inspected by the VirusViz Web application; epitope regions are highlighted within the given viral protein, and changes can be comparatively inspected. For sequences mutated within the epitope, we also offer a complete view of the distribution of amino acid changes, optionally grouped by the location, collection date or lineage. Thanks to these functionalities, EpiSurf supports the user-friendly testing of epitope conservancy within selected populations of interest, which can be of utmost relevance for designing vaccines, drugs or serological assays. EpiSurf is available at two endpoints.Database URL: http://gmql.eu/episurf/ (for searching GenBank and COG-UK sequences) and http://gmql.eu/episurf\_gisaid/ (for GISAID sequences).}

  abstract = {The integration of genomic metadata is, at the same time, an important, difficult, and well-recognized challenge. It is important because a wealth of public data repositories is available to drive biological and clinical research; combining information from various heterogeneous and widely dispersed sources is paramount to a number of biological discoveries. It is difficult because the domain is complex and there is no agreement among the various metadata definitions, which refer to different vocabularies and ontologies. It is well-recognized in the bioinformatics community because, in the common practice, repositories are accessed one-by-one, learning their specific metadata definitions as result of long and tedious efforts, and such practice is error-prone. In this paper, we describe META-BASE, an architecture for integrating metadata extracted from a variety of genomic data sources, based upon a structured transformation process. We present a variety of innovative techniques for data extraction, cleaning, normalization and enrichment. We propose a general, open and extensible pipeline that can easily incorporate any number of new data sources, and propose the resulting repository--already integrating several important sources--which is exposed by means of practical user interfaces to respond biological researchers' needs.},

To assess whether models' have learned human-aligned abstractions, we introduce abstraction alignment, a methodology to compare model behavior against formal human knowledge. Abstraction alignment externalizes domain-specific human knowledge as an abstraction graph, a set of pertinent concepts spanning levels of abstraction. Using the abstraction graph as a ground truth, abstraction alignment measures the alignment of a model's behavior by determining how much of its uncertainty is accounted for by the human abstractions. By aggregating abstraction alignment across entire datasets, users can test alignment hypotheses, such as which human concepts the model has learned and where misalignments recur. In evaluations with experts, abstraction alignment differentiates seemingly similar errors, improves the verbosity of existing model-quality metrics, and uncovers improvements to current human abstractions.},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character \$n\$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character \$n\$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

The finding that oncogenic mutations in BRAF are common in melanoma followed by the demonstration that these tumors are dependent on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway offered hope that inhibition of B-RAF kinase activity could benefit melanoma patients. Herein, we describe the structure-guided discovery of PLX4032 (RG7204), a potent inhibitor of oncogenic B-RAF kinase activity. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that PLX4032 selectively blocked the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in BRAF mutant cells and caused regression of BRAF mutant xenografts. Toxicology studies confirmed a wide safety margin consistent with the high degree of selectivity, enabling Phase 1 clinical trials using a crystalline formulation of PLX4032. In a subset of melanoma patients, pathway inhibition was monitored in paired biopsy specimens collected before treatment initiation and following two weeks of treatment. This analysis revealed substantial inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, yet clinical evaluation did not show tumor regressions. At higher drug exposures afforded by a new amorphous drug formulation,, greater than 80\% inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in the tumors of patients correlated with clinical response. Indeed, the Phase 1 clinical data revealed a remarkably high 81\% response rate in metastatic melanoma patients treated at an oral dose of 960 mg twice daily. These data demonstrate that BRAF-mutant melanomas are highly dependent on B-RAF kinase activity.},

Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16\%--21\% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells.

Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.},

We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), this has not been clearly determined. The monocyte subpopulations in patients with SLE, patients with other autoimmune diseases, and healthy controls were evaluated. The effects of nonclassic monocytes and apoptotic cells (ACs) on the differentiation and function of CD14++CD16- monocytes were also studied. Methods Monocyte subpopulations derived from the blood samples of SLE patients (n = 88), patients with other autoimmune diseases (n = 37), and healthy control subjects (n = 61) were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To evaluate the effect of CD14+CD16++ monocytes and ACs on the differentiation of CD14++CD16- monocytes, we developed a coculture model of highly purified sorted monocyte subpopulations, which were reconstituted with defined proportions of CD14++CD16- and CD14+CD16++ monocytes in the presence or absence of ACs. After differentiation into macrophages, CD3+ lymphocytes were added, and the proliferating cells and CD3+IFN{$\gamma$}+ cells were evaluated. A cytokine bead array panel was used to test the coculture supernatants. Results There was a reduction in CD14+CD16++ monocytes in patients with active SLE. Monocytes from SLE patients had decreased expression of HLA--DR and decreased ability to bind and phagocytize ACs. In healthy controls, but not SLE patients, treatment with macrophages derived from CD14+CD16++ monocytes reduced T cell proliferation and proliferating CD3+IFN{$\gamma$}+ cells and increased the accumulation of tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$}, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and IL-1{$\beta$}. Conclusion Our findings show that CD14+CD16++ monocytes, a population that is reduced and nonfunctional in SLE patients, have modulatory effects on CD14++CD16- monocytes and T cells.},

  abstract = {Many valuable resources developed by world-wide research institutions and consortia describe genomic datasets that are both open and available for secondary research, but their metadata search interfaces are heterogeneous, not interoperable and sometimes with very limited capabilities. We implemented GenoSurf, a multi-ontology semantic search system providing access to a consolidated collection of metadata attributes found in the most relevant genomic datasets; values of 10 attributes are semantically enriched by making use of the most suited available ontologies. The user of GenoSurf provides as input the search terms, sets the desired level of ontological enrichment and obtains as output the identity of matching data files at the various sources. Search is facilitated by drop-down lists of matching values; aggregate counts describing resulting files are updated in real time while the search terms are progressively added. In addition to the consolidated attributes, users can perform keyword-based searches on the original (raw) metadata, which are also imported; GenoSurf supports the interplay of attribute-based and keyword-based search through well-defined interfaces. Currently, GenoSurf integrates about 40 million metadata of several major valuable data sources, including three providers of clinical and experimental data (TCGA, ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics) and two sources of annotation data (GENCODE and RefSeq); it can be used as a standalone resource for targeting the genomic datasets at their original sources (identified with their accession IDs and URLs), or as part of an integrated query answering system for performing complex queries over genomic regions and metadata.}

In the Gene Expression Omnibus, for example, descriptions of genomic samples lack structure, with different terminology (such as ``breast cancer'', ``breast tumor'', and ``malignant neoplasm of breast'') used to express the same concept. To remedy this, we learn models to extract salient information from this textual metadata. Rather than treating the problem as classification or named entity recognition, we model it as machine translation, leveraging state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models to directly map unstructured input into a structured text format. The application of such models greatly simplifies training and allows for imputation of output fields that are implied but never explicitly mentioned in the input text.},

Here we describe sci-CAR, a combinatorial indexing--based coassay that jointly profiles chromatin accessibility and mRNA (CAR) in each of thousands of single cells. As a proof of concept, we apply sci-CAR to 4825 cells, including a time series of dexamethasone treatment, as well as to 11,296 cells from the adult mouse kidney. With the resulting data, we compare the pseudotemporal dynamics of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, reconstruct the chromatin accessibility profiles of cell types defined by RNA profiles, and link cis-regulatory sites to their target genes on the basis of the covariance of chromatin accessibility and transcription across large numbers of single cells.}

  abstract = {Background RNA-Seq, the high-throughput sequencing (HT-Seq) of mRNAs, has become an essential tool for characterizing gene expression differences between different cell types and conditions. Gene expression is regulated by several mechanisms, including epigenetically by post-translational histone modifications which can be assessed by ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation Sequencing). As more and more biological samples are analyzed by the combination of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, the integrated analysis of the corresponding data sets becomes, theoretically, a unique option to study gene regulation. However, technically such analyses are still in their infancy. Results Here we introduce intePareto, a computational tool for the integrative analysis of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data. With intePareto we match RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data at the level of genes, perform differential expression analysis between biological conditions, and prioritize genes with consistent changes in RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data using Pareto optimization. Conclusion intePareto facilitates comprehensive understanding of high dimensional transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Its superiority to a naive differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq and available integrative approach is demonstrated by analyzing a public dataset.

The core of human cognition lies in the structured, reusable concepts that help us to rapidly adapt to new tasks and provide reasoning behind our decisions. However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strong meta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15\% relative improvement on the most challenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providing interpretations behind the model's predictions.},

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

New models and methods to easily access, integrate and search them effectively are needed. An effort was made by the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), which defined strict procedures for harmonizing genomic and clinical data of cancer, and created the GDC data portal with its application programming interface (API). In this work, we enhance GDC harmonization by applying a state of the art data model (called Genomic Data Model) made of two components: the genomic data, in Browser Extensible Data (BED) format, and the related metadata, in a tab-delimited key-value format. Furthermore, we extend the GDC genomic data with information extracted from other public genomic databases (e.g., GENCODE, HGNC and miRBase). For metadata, we implemented automatic procedures to extract and normalize them, recognizing and eliminating redundant ones, from both Clinical/Biospecimen Supplements and GDC Data Model, that are present on the two sources of GDC (i.e., data portal and API). We developed and released the OpenGDC software, which is able to extract, integrate, extend, and standardize genomic and clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from the GDC. Additionally, we created a publicly accessible repository, containing such homogenized and enhanced TCGA data (resulting in about 1.3 TB). Our approach, implemented in the OpenGDC software, provides a step forward to the effective and efficient management of big genomic and clinical data of cancer. The strong usability of our data model and utility of our work is demonstrated through the application of the GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) on the transformed TCGA data from the GDC, achieving promising results, facilitating information retrieval and knowledge discovery analyses.},

Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture -- prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training without any annotations for parts of images. We demonstrate our method on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the Stanford Cars dataset. Our experiments show that ProtoPNet can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous non-interpretable counterpart, and when several ProtoPNets are combined into a larger network, it can achieve an accuracy that is on par with some of the best-performing deep models. Moreover, ProtoPNet provides a level of interpretability that is absent in other interpretable deep models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

Computational methods for automatic cell type annotation are urgently needed given the exponential growth in the number of cells. In particular, annotation of single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scCAS) data, which can capture the chromatin regulatory landscape that governs transcription in each cell type, has not been fully investigated. Here we propose EpiAnno, a probabilistic generative model integrated with a Bayesian neural network, to annotate scCAS data automatically in a supervised manner. We systematically validate the superior performance of EpiAnno for both intra- and inter-dataset annotation on various datasets. We further demonstrate the advantages of EpiAnno for interpretable embedding and biological implications via expression enrichment analysis, partitioned heritability analysis, enhancer identification, cis-coaccessibility analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, we show that EpiAnno has the potential to reveal cell type-specific motifs and facilitate scCAS data simulation.},

  abstract = {Large-scale foundation models have recently opened new avenues for artificial general intelligence. Such a research paradigm has recently shown considerable promise in the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, while to date, efforts have centered on transcriptome. In contrast to gene expression, chromatin accessibility provides more decisive insights into cell states, shaping the chromatin regulatory landscapes that control transcription in distinct cell types. Yet, challenges also persist due to the abundance of features, high data sparsity, and the quasi-binary nature of these data. Here, we introduce EpiAgent, the first foundation model for single-cell epigenomic data, pretrained on a large-scale Human-scATAC-Corpus comprising approximately 5 million cells and 35 billion tokens. EpiAgent encodes chromatin accessibility patterns of cells as concise ``cell sentences,'' and employs bidirectional attention to capture cellular heterogeneity behind regulatory networks. With comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that EpiAgent excels in typical downstream tasks, including unsupervised feature extraction, supervised cell annotation, and data imputation. By incorporating external embeddings, EpiAgent facilitates the prediction of cellular responses to both out-of-sample stimulated and unseen genetic perturbations, as well as reference data integration and query data mapping. By simulating the knockout of key cis-regulatory elements, EpiAgent enables in-silico treatment for cancer analysis. We further extended zero-shot capabilities of EpiAgent, allowing direct cell type annotation on newly sequenced datasets without additional training.},

  abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems---patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients---and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.},

ABL therefore represents a crucial target for new therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the molecular pathways that are abnormally activated by the oncoprotein. Such pathways may provide additional opportunities to develop new drugs to overcome the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In particular, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway can be effectively blocked by mTOR inhibitors, and several compounds can hit the RAS pathway and the resulting mitogen-activated protein (MAP) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (MEK) and MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, mitotic kinases can be blocked by Aurora kinase inhibitors, and Pim kinases can be blocked by selective serine-threonine kinase inhibitors. Finally, the abnormal pathways that sustain the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells are described as possible targets to completely eradicate leukemic clones. Such pathways include the Hedgehog pathway, which can be blocked by Smoothened inhibitors, and the CXCR4/SDF1 axis, which can be targeted by specific antagonists.

While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.},

Some 20 drugs that target kinases have been approved for clinical use over the past decade, and hundreds more are undergoing clinical trials. However, the recent approval of the first protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, coupled with an enhanced understanding of the signaling networks that control the immune system, suggests that there will be a surge of interest in this area over the next 10 years. In this connection, we discuss opportunities for targeting protein kinases in the MyD88 signaling network for the development of drugs to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Activating mutations in protein kinases underlie many other diseases and conditions, and we also discuss why the protein kinases SPAK/OSR1 and LRRK2 have recently become interesting targets for the treatment of hypertension and Parkinson's disease, respectively, and the progress that has been made in developing LRRK2 inhibitors. Finally we suggest that more focus on the identification of inhibitors of kinase activation, rather than kinase activity, may pay dividends in identifying exquisitely specific inhibitors of signal transduction cascades, and we also highlight ``pseudo-kinases'' as an attractive and unexplored area for drug development that merits much more attention in the years to come.}

Th cells control adaptive immunity against pathogens and cancer by activating other effector immune cells. Treg cells are defined as CD4+ T cells in charge of suppressing potentially deleterious activities of Th cells. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge in the Treg field and defines some key questions that remain to be answered. Suggested functions for Treg cells include: prevention of autoimmune diseases by maintaining self-tolerance; suppression of allergy, asthma and pathogen-induced immunopathology; feto-maternal tolerance; and oral tolerance. Identification of Treg cells remains problematic, because accumulating evidence suggests that all the presently-used Treg markers (CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, CD127 and Foxp3) represent general T-cell activation markers, rather than being truly Treg-specific. Treg-cell activation is antigen-specific, which implies that suppressive activities of Treg cells are antigen-dependent. It has been proposed that Treg cells would be self-reactive, but extensive TCR repertoire analysis suggests that self-reactivity may be the exception rather than the rule. The classification of Treg cells as a separate lineage remains controversial because the ability to suppress is not an exclusive Treg property. Suppressive activities attributed to Treg cells may in reality, at least in some experimental settings, be exerted by conventional Th cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and T follicular (Tfh) cells. Recent reports have also demonstrated that Foxp3+ Treg cells may differentiate in vivo into conventional effector Th cells, with or without concomitant downregulation of Foxp3.},

Accordingly, CD4+CD25(bright) cells were decreased in patients with active disease compared to healthy subjects (P{$<$}0.001). IL-12 production was hampered in cells from patients during periods of active disease when compared to healthy controls and patients during remission (P{$<$}0.001).

  abstract = {Generative pretrained models have achieved remarkable success in various domains such as language and computer vision. Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference.},

SLK promotes apoptosis, in part, via pathway(s) involving apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. This study addresses the role of p53 as a potential effector of SLK. p53 transactivation was measured after transient transfection of a luciferase reporter plasmid that contains a p53 cis-acting enhancer element. Overexpression of SLK in COS-1 cells and cotransfection of SLK and p53-wild type (wt) cDNAs in glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) stimulated p53 transactivational activity, as measured by a p53 response element-driven luciferase reporter. In GECs, chemical anoxia followed by glucose reexposure (in vitro ischemia-reperfusion) increased p53 reporter activity, and this increase was amplified by overexpression of SLK. Expression of SLK induced p53 phosphorylation on serine (S)-33 and S315. In GECs, cotransfection of SLK with p53-wt, p53-S33A, p53-S315A, or p53-S33A+S315A mutants showed that only the double mutation abolished the SLK-induced increase in p53 reporter activity. SLK-induced stimulation of p53 reporter activity was attenuated by inhibition of JNK. Overexpression of SLK amplified apoptosis induced by subjecting cells to in vitro ischemia-reperfusion injury, while ectopic expression of a dominant negative SLK mutant attenuated the ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis. The p53 transactivation inhibitor pifithrin-alpha significantly attenuated the amount of apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion and SLK overexpression. Thus SLK induces p53 phosphorylation and transactivation, which enhances apoptosis after in vitro ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Expression and activation of SLK are increased in kidney development and during recovery from ischemic acute kidney injury. Overexpression of SLK in glomerular epithelial cells/podocytes in vivo induces injury and proteinuria. Conversely, reduced SLK expression leads to abnormalities in cell adhesion, spreading, and motility. Tight regulation of SLK expression thus may be critical for normal renal structure and function. We produced podocyte-specific SLK-knockout mice to address the functional role of SLK in podocytes. Mice with podocyte-specific deletion of SLK showed reduced glomerular SLK expression and activity compared with control. Podocyte-specific deletion of SLK resulted in albuminuria at 4--5 mo of age in male mice and 8--9 mo in female mice, which persisted for up to 13 mo. At 11--12 mo, knockout mice showed ultrastructural changes, including focal foot process effacement and microvillous transformation of podocyte plasma membranes. Mean foot process width was approximately twofold greater in knockout mice compared with control. Podocyte number was reduced by 35\% in knockout mice compared with control, and expression of nephrin, synaptopodin, and podocalyxin was reduced in knockout mice by 20--30\%. In summary, podocyte-specific deletion of SLK leads to albuminuria, loss of podocytes, and morphological evidence of podocyte injury. Thus, SLK is essential to the maintenance of podocyte integrity as mice age.},

Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the representations alone match or outperform specialized methods on 11 of 18 prediction tasks, and up to 15 after fine-tuning. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learnt to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations alone can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence alone.},

These do not represent true biological variations between samples and can lead to false conclusions or hinder the ability to integrate multiple datasets. Since there is a growing need for the joint analysis of single-cell sequencing datasets from different sources, there is also a need to correct the resulting batch effects while maintaining the true biological variations in the data.We developed a semi-supervised deep learning architecture called Autoencoder-based Batch Correction (ABC) for integrating single-cell sequencing datasets. Our method removes batch effects through a guided process of data compression using supervised cell type classifier branches for biological signal retention. It aligns the different batches using an adversarial training approach. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our method using four single-cell sequencing datasets and multiple measures for batch effect removal and biological variation conservation. ABC outperforms 10 state-of-the-art methods for this task including Seurat, scGen, ComBat, scanorama, scVI, scANVI, AutoClass, Harmony, scDREAMER, and CLEAR, correcting various types of batch effects while preserving intricate biological variations.}

  abstract = {State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 1.6\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 1.3B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.},

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4\${\textbackslash}times\$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40{\textbackslash}\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73{\textbackslash}\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72{\textbackslash}\% model FLOPs utilization).},

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a potential solution to dissect the heterogeneity of the disease and enables the study of similar cell types distant from the site of renal injury to identify novel biomarkers. We applied scRNA-seq to human renal and skin biopsy tissues and demonstrated that scRNA-seq can be performed on samples obtained during routine care. Chronicity index, IgG deposition, and quantity of proteinuria correlated with a transcriptomic-based score composed of IFN-inducible genes in renal tubular cells. Furthermore, analysis of cumulative expression profiles of single cell keratinocytes dissociated from nonlesional, non--sun-exposed skin of patients with lupus nephritis also revealed upregulation of IFN-inducible genes compared with keratinocytes isolated from healthy controls. This indicates the possible use of scRNA-seq analysis of skin biopsies as a biomarker of renal disease. These data support the potential utility of scRNA-seq to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and pave the way for exploiting a readily accessible tissue to reflect injury in the kidney., Single cell RNA-seq on clinical samples provides insights into lupus nephritis pathogenesis and suggests that skin biopsy may reflect injury in the kidney.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

AURKA shows significantly higher expression in cancer tissues than in normal control tissues for multiple tumor types according to the TCGA database. Activation of AURKA has been demonstrated to play an important role in a wide range of cancers, and numerous AURKA substrates have been identified. AURKA-mediated phosphorylation can regulate the functions of AURKA substrates, some of which are mitosis regulators, tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In addition, enrichment of AURKA-interacting proteins with KEGG pathway and GO analysis have demonstrated that these proteins are involved in classic oncogenic pathways. All of this evidence favors the idea of AURKA as a target for cancer therapy, and some small molecules targeting AURKA have been discovered. These AURKA inhibitors (AKIs) have been tested in preclinical studies, and some of them have been subjected to clinical trials as monotherapies or in combination with classic chemotherapy or other targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Background: Mucinous carcinoma (also known as colloid carcinoma) is a particular type of breast cancer characterized by the presence of extracellular mucin and is linked with a more favorable prognosis than invasive breast carcinoma of no special type. Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is an uncommon form of breast tumor, often presenting as a lobulated, moderately well circumscribed mass on mammography, sonography, and MRI imaging. It accounts for 1 to 7\% of all breast cancers. Pure mucinous breast carcinomas are rare and account for about 2\% of all primary breast carcinomas. Metastatic disease happens at a lower rate than in other types of invasive carcinoma. Methods: We present our 5 year experience with this particular pathology in a retrospective review study. Results: We identified 25 patients with mixed and pure mucinous breast cancer, the tumor size varied greatly from 2 to 19 cm in diameter. A subset of mixed mucinous carcinomas (8 cases) showed neuroendocrine differentiation or other associated premalignant lessions. Conclusion: Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is a rare entity with a favorable prognosis due to low incidence of lymph node metastases. Pure mucinous breast carcinoma has an even rare.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life. To facilitate future work, we released our models at https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans.},

IL-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine, which modulates immune cell trafficking and is involved inflammation in (auto)immune and infectious diseases. But the role of IL-17A still remains controversial. In the current study, we investigated effects of IL-17A on advanced murine and human atherosclerosis, the common disease phenotype in clinical care. The 26-wk-old apolipoprotein E--deficient mice were fed a standard chow diet and treated either with IL-17A mAb (n = 15) or irrelevant Ig (n = 10) for 16 wk. Furthermore, essential mechanisms of IL-17A in atherogenesis were studied in vitro. Inhibition of IL-17A markedly prevented atherosclerotic lesion progression (p = 0.001) by reducing inflammatory burden and cellular infiltration (p = 0.01) and improved lesion stability (p = 0.01). In vitro experiments showed that IL-17A plays a role in chemoattractance, monocyte adhesion, and sensitization of APCs toward pathogen-derived TLR4 ligands. Also, IL-17A induced a unique transcriptome pattern in monocyte-derived macrophages distinct from known macrophage types. Stimulation of human carotid plaque tissue ex vivo with IL-17A induced a proinflammatory milieu and upregulation of molecules expressed by the IL-17A--induced macrophage subtype. In this study, we show that functional blockade of IL-17A prevents atherosclerotic lesion progression and induces plaque stabilization in advanced lesions in apolipoprotein E--deficient mice. The underlying mechanisms involve reduced inflammation and distinct effects of IL-17A on monocyte/macrophage lineage. In addition, translational experiments underline the relevance for the human system.},

  abstract = {Replacing static word embeddings with contextualized word representations has yielded significant improvements on many NLP tasks. However, just how contextual are the contextualized representations produced by models such as ELMo and BERT? Are there infinitely many context-specific representations for each word, or are words essentially assigned one of a finite number of word-sense representations? For one, we find that the contextualized representations of all words are not isotropic in any layer of the contextualizing model. While representations of the same word in different contexts still have a greater cosine similarity than those of two different words, this self-similarity is much lower in upper layers. This suggests that upper layers of contextualizing models produce more context-specific representations, much like how upper layers of LSTMs produce more task-specific representations. In all layers of ELMo, BERT, and GPT-2, on average, less than 5\% of the variance in a word's contextualized representations can be explained by a static embedding for that word, providing some justification for the success of contextualized representations.},

We also discuss the impacts as well as limitations of current pre-train schemes and model scaling strategies for Transformer in vision through YOLOS.

Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by sample heterogeneity. Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volume of data pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC dissects cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nystr{\"o}m method, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis reveals {\textasciitilde}370,000 candidate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate cell-type specific transcriptional regulators.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4+ T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that {$\sim$}90\% of causal variants are non-coding, with {$\sim$}60\% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10--20\% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.},

The described method enables single-cell analysis of DNA methylation in a broad range of biological systems, including embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer.

  abstract = {Genomic data is frequently stored as segments or intervals. Because this data type is so common, interval-based comparisons are fundamental to genomic analysis. As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.We present a new data structure, the Augmented Interval List (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N+n+m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5--18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees, nested containment lists or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4--60\% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.An implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at http://ailist.databio.org.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

Yet, search of relevant datasets for knowledge discovery is limitedly supported: metadata describing ENCODE datasets are quite simple and incomplete, and not described by a coherent underlying ontology. Here, we show how to overcome this limitation, by adopting an ENCODE metadata searching approach which uses high-quality ontological knowledge and state-of-the-art indexing technologies. Specifically, we developed S.O.S. GeM(http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/SOSGeM/), a system supporting effective semantic search and retrieval of ENCODE datasets. First, we constructed a Semantic Knowledge Base by starting with concepts extracted from ENCODE metadata, matched to and expanded on biomedical ontologies integrated in the well-established Unified Medical Language System. We prove that this inference method is sound and complete. Then, we leveraged the Semantic Knowledge Base to semantically search ENCODE data from arbitrary biologists' queries. This allows correctly finding more datasets than those extracted by a purely syntactic search, as supported by the other available systems. We empirically show the relevance of found datasets to the biologists' queries.},

In functional proteomics analyses, large- scale profiling of kinases has become feasible through the use of affinity pulldown beads that carry immobilized kinase inhibitors. As an alternative approach to solid phase beads, Capture Compound Mass Spectrometry (CCMS) enables the functional isolation of protein-classes on the basis of small molecule-protein interactions in solution. Capture Compounds are trifunctional probes: a selectivity function interacts with the native target proteins in equilibrium, upon irradiation a photoactivatable reactivity function forms an irreversible covalent bond to the target proteins, and a sorting function allows the captured proteins to be isolated from a complex protein mixture. We report the design and application of a novel, fully water-soluble Capture Compound that carries the broadband kinase inhibitor staurosporine as selectivity function. We used this Capture Compound to profile the kinome of the human liver-derived cell line HepG2 and identified one hundred kinases. HepG2 cells are a widely used model system for hepatocarcinoma, hepatitis, and for investigation of drug toxicity effects. CCMS experiments in membrane fractions of human placenta are given as example for the applicability to human tissue.}

The data showed which elements boost and which elements hurt perceptions of Web credibility. Through analysis we found these elements fell into one of seven factors. In order of impact, the five types of elements that increased credibility perceptions were ``real-world feel'', ``ease of use'', ``expertise'', ``trustworthiness'', and ``tailoring''. The two types of elements that hurt credibility were ``commercial implications\&rdquo ;and ``amateurism''.

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

Still, how a given DNA sequence encodes a particular locus-specific folding pattern remains unknown. Here we present a convolutional neural network, Akita, that accurately predicts genome folding from DNA sequence alone. Representations learned by Akita underscore the importance of an orientation-specific grammar for CTCF binding sites. Akita learns predictive nucleotide-level features of genome folding, revealing effects of nucleotides beyond the core CTCF motif. Once trained, Akita enables rapid in silico predictions. Accounting for this, we demonstrate how Akita can be used to perform in silico saturation mutagenesis, interpret eQTLs, make predictions for structural variants and probe species-specific genome folding. Collectively, these results enable decoding genome function from sequence through structure.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamics of the binding of L-arabinose and of D-galactose to the L-arabinose-binding protein of Escherichia coli have been studied by isothermal and scanning calorimetry. The binding reaction with arabinose is characterized by an enthalpy change of -15.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees C, and a large decrease in apparent heat capacity, amounting to -0.44 +/- 0.05 kcal K-1 mol-1, which is constant over the temperature range 8 to 30 degrees C. Very similar results were obtained with D-galactose. These calorimetric results have been combined with binding constants determined by equilibrium dialysis (Clark, A. F., Gerken, T. A., and Hogg, R. W. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2227-2233) to obtain free energy and entropy changes over the range 5 to 30 degrees C, and by extrapolation to 60 degrees C. The protein undergoes reversible unfolding on being heated with an increase in enthalpy at 53.5 degrees C of 151.8 +/- 1.1 kcal mol-1 (169.2 +/- 1.2 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C) and in apparent heat capacity of 3.16 +/- 0.07 kcal K-1 mol-1. In the presence of arabinose, the unfolding enthalpy is increased to 200.7 +/- 1.8 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C, the increase being due to the enthalpy of dissociation of the ligand which amounts to 31 kcal mol-1 at the unfolding temperature. The unfolding temperature is increased by the presence of excess arabinose or galactose, an effect which is due solely to displacement by the added ligand of the unfolding-dissociation equilibrium. The thermodynamic data are discussed in connection with the detailed structural information available for this system from x-ray crystallography (Newcomer, M. E., Gilliland, G. L. and Quiocho, F. A.

Unexpectedly, the Fbn2 loop was both rare and dynamic, with a looped fraction of approximately 3 to 6.5\% and a median loop lifetime of approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Our results establish that the Fbn2 TAD is highly dynamic, and about 92\% of the time, cohesin-extruded loops exist within the TAD without bridging both CTCF boundaries. This suggests that single CTCF boundaries, rather than the fully CTCF-CTCF looped state, may be the primary regulators of functional interactions.}

In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep" features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation. Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.},

Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains.

Protein structural modeling, such as predicting structure from amino acid sequence and evolutionary information, designing proteins toward desirable functionality, or predicting properties or behavior of a protein, is critical to understand and engineer biological systems at the molecular level. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in applying deep learning techniques to tackle problems in protein structural modeling and design. We dissect the emerging approaches using deep learning techniques for protein structural modeling, and discuss advances and challenges that must be addressed. We argue for the central importance of structure, following the "sequence -{$>$} structure -{$>$} function" paradigm. This review is directed to help both computational biologists to gain familiarity with the deep learning methods applied in protein modeling, and computer scientists to gain perspective on the biologically meaningful problems that may benefit from deep learning techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SimCSE, a simple contrastive learning framework that greatly advances state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. We first describe an unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised counterparts. We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation, and removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning framework by using "entailment" pairs as positives and "contradiction" pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3\% and 81.6\% Spearman's correlation respectively, a 4.2\% and 2.2\% improvement compared to the previous best results. We also show -- both theoretically and empirically -- that the contrastive learning objective regularizes pre-trained embeddings' anisotropic space to be more uniform, and it better aligns positive pairs when supervised signals are available.},

  abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G+C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5' and 3' CpG islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5' CpG islands extended through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the 3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes, composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG islands. G/C boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3' CpG islands, as well as in 5' CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5' CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested: that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the structural stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG islands associated with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for the maintenance of CpG islands as "methylation-free zones" in germline DNA.},

Detecting differences in thermal stability due to target engagement requires high quantitative accuracy and consistent detection. Isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) are used to multiplex samples and increase quantification precision in TPP analysis by data-dependent acquisition (DDA). However, advances in data-independent acquisition (DIA) can provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage with reduced costs and sample preparation steps. Herein, we explored the performance of different DIA-based label-free quantification (LFQ) approaches compared to TMT-DDA for thermal shift quantitation. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells were treated with losmapimod, a known inhibitor of MAPK14 (p38{$\alpha$}). Label-free DIA approaches, and particularly the library-free mode in DIA-NN, were comparable or better than TMT-DDA in their ability to reproducibly detect target engagement of losmapimod with MAPK14 and one of its downstream targets, MAPKAPK3. Using DIA for thermal shift quantitation is a cost-effective alternative to labelled quantitation in the TPP pipeline.},

  abstract = {Motivation Genomic region sets summarize functional genomics data and define locations of interest in the genome such as regulatory regions or transcription factor binding sites. The number of publicly available region sets has increased dramatically, leading to challenges in data analysis. Results We propose a new method to represent genomic region sets as vectors, or embeddings, using an adapted word2vec approach. We compared our approach to two simpler methods based on interval unions or term frequency-inverse document frequency and evaluated the methods in three ways: First, by classifying the cell line, antibody, or tissue type of the region set; second, by assessing whether similarity among embeddings can reflect simulated random perturbations of genomic regions; and third, by testing robustness of the proposed representations to different signal thresholds for calling peaks. Our word2vec-based region set embeddings reduce dimensionality from more than a hundred thousand to 100 without significant loss in classification performance. The vector representation could identify cell line, antibody, and tissue type with over 90\% accuracy. We also found that the vectors could quantitatively summarize simulated random perturbations to region sets and are more robust to subsampling the data derived from different peak calling thresholds. Our evaluations demonstrate that the vectors retain useful biological information in relatively lower-dimensional spaces. We propose that vector representation of region sets is a promising approach for efficient analysis of genomic region data. Availability https://github.com/databio/regionset-embedding},

A common approach is simple string matching to compare a search term to metadata, but this is limited by incomplete or inaccurate annotations. An alternative is to compare data directly through genomic region overlap analysis, but this approach leads to challenges like sparsity, high dimensionality, and computational expense. We require novel methods to quickly and flexibly query large, messy genomic interval databases. Here, we develop a genomic interval search system using representation learning. We train numerical embeddings for a collection of region sets simultaneously with their metadata labels, capturing similarity between region sets and their metadata in a low-dimensional space. Using these learned co-embeddings, we develop a system that solves three related information retrieval tasks using embedding distance computations: retrieving region sets related to a user query string, suggesting new labels for database region sets, and retrieving database region sets similar to a query region set. We evaluate these use cases and show that jointly learned representations of region sets and metadata are a promising approach for fast, flexible, and accurate genomic region information retrieval.},

  abstract = {Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400--1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven a fundamental tool to identify common variants associated to complex traits, thus contributing to unveil the genetic components of human disease. Besides, the advent of GWAS contributed to expose unexpected findings that urged to redefine the framework of population genetics. First, loci identified by GWAS had small effect sizes and could only explain a fraction of the predicted heritability of the traits under study. Second, the majority of GWAS hits mapped within non-coding regions (such as intergenic or intronic regions) where new functional RNA species (such as lncRNAs or circRNAs) have started to emerge. Bigger cohorts, meta-analysis and technical improvements in genotyping allowed identification of an increased number of genetic variants associated to coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiometabolic traits. The challenge remains to infer causal mechanisms by which these variants influence cardiovascular disease development. A tendency to assign potential causal variants preferentially to coding genes close to lead variants contributed to disregard the role of non-coding elements. In recent years, in parallel to an increased knowledge of the non-coding genome, new studies started to characterize disease-associated variants located within non-coding RNA regions. The upcoming of databases integrating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and non-coding RNAs together with novel technologies will hopefully facilitate the discovery of causal non-coding variants associated to disease. This review attempts to summarize the current knowledge of genetic variation within non-coding regions with a focus on long non-coding RNAs that have widespread impact in cardiometabolic diseases.},

To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a DNA microarray. FAIRE performed in human cells strongly enriches DNA coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, and active promoters.

OCRs usually indicate active regulatory elements in the genome and are directly associated with the gene regulatory network. The identification of differential accessibility regions (DARs) between different biological conditions is critical in determining the differential activity of regulatory elements. Differential analysis of ATAC-seq shares many similarities with differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. However, the distribution of ATAC-seq signal intensity is different from that of RNA-seq data, and higher sensitivity is required for DARs identification. Many different tools can be used to perform differential analysis of ATAC-seq data, but a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking of these methods is still lacking. Here, we used simulated datasets to systematically measure the sensitivity and specificity of six different methods. We further discussed the statistical and signal density cut-offs in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq by applying them to real data. Batch effects are very common in high-throughput sequencing experiments. We illustrated that batch-effect correction can dramatically improve sensitivity in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq data. Finally, we developed a user-friendly package, BeCorrect, to perform batch effect correction and visualization of corrected ATAC-seq signals in a genome browser.},

In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

Immunological synapse formation is now shown to be an active and dynamic mechanism that allows T cells to distinguish potential antigenic ligands. Initially, T cell receptor ligands were engaged in an outermost ring of the nascent synapse. Transport of these complexes into the central cluster was dependent on T cell receptor--ligand interaction kinetics. Finally, formation of a stable central cluster at the heart of the synapse was a determinative event for T cell proliferation.}

Using this approach, we establish a normal epigenetic baseline for healthy blood development, which we then use to deconvolve aberrant molecular features within blood from patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia4,5. Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort, we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as patient-specific regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified 91,601 putative peak-to-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate leukemia-specific genes, such as RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69. These results demonstrate how integrative, multiomic analysis of single cells within the framework of normal development can reveal both distinct and shared molecular mechanisms of disease from patient samples.},

The raw expression data from microarray and other high-throughput technologies is deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and served as Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) files. However, to extract and analyze differentially expressed genes from GEO requires significant computational skills. RESULTS: Here we introduce GEO2Enrichr, a browser extension for extracting differentially expressed gene sets from GEO and analyzing those sets with Enrichr, an independent gene set enrichment analysis tool containing over 70\,000 annotated gene sets organized into 75 gene-set libraries. GEO2Enrichr adds JavaScript code to GEO web-pages; this code scrapes user selected accession numbers and metadata, and then, with one click, users can submit this information to a web-server application that downloads the SOFT files, parses, cleans and normalizes the data, identifies the differentially expressed genes, and then pipes the resulting gene lists to Enrichr for downstream functional analysis. GEO2Enrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to major bioinformatics resources such GEO by integrating tools and resources without the need for a plug-in architecture. Importantly, GEO2Enrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses with little technical overhead, lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data processing steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository GEO. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GEO2Enrichr is an open source tool, freely available for installation as browser extensions at the Chrome Web Store and FireFox Add-ons.

  abstract = {Background: Many types of data from genomic analyses can be represented as genomic tracks, i.e. features linked to the genomic coordinates of a reference genome. Examples of such data are epigenetic DNA methylation data, ChIP-seq peaks, germline or somatic DNA variants, as well as RNA-seq expression levels. Researchers often face difficulties in locating, accessing and combining relevant tracks from external sources, as well as locating the raw data, reducing the value of the generated information.,  Description of work: We propose to advance the application of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to produce searchable metadata for genomic tracks. Findability and Accessibility of metadata can then be ensured by a track search service that integrates globally identifiable metadata from various track hubs in the Track Hub Registry and other relevant repositories. Interoperability and Reusability need to be ensured by the specification and implementation of a basic set of recommendations for metadata. We have tested this concept by developing such a specification in a JSON Schema, called FAIRtracks, and have integrated it into a novel track search service, called TrackFind. We demonstrate practical usage by importing datasets through TrackFind into existing examples of relevant analytical tools for genomic tracks: EPICO and the GSuite HyperBrowser.,  Conclusion: We here provide a first iteration of a draft standard for genomic track metadata, as well as the accompanying software ecosystem. It can easily be adapted or extended to future needs of the research community regarding data, methods and tools, balancing the requirements of both data submitters and analytical end-users.},

Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories.},

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

About 70\% of participants utilized Anki in the course and the usage increased significantly from Week 1 to Weeks 7 and 13.~There was variation to how many days a week students used Anki. Survey data shows that students value formal lectures and prefer to supplement their studies with Anki.

With the average price of cancer drugs doubling in the last decade, the unsustainability of drug prices is especially concerning in oncology and hematology. The objective of this study was to compare the prices of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved in the last 20 years by the FDA across disease states. STUDY DESIGN: We identified all indications approved by the FDA for mAbs from 1997 to 2016 and calculated the annual price of 1-year treatment for each mAb-indication combination as the product of the US average wholesale price per milligram and the recommended dose. METHODS: We compared the annual price of treatment with each mAb across disease states using generalized linear models with gamma distribution and log link, controlling for route of administration, chemical structure, source, and time since FDA approval. RESULTS: The average annual price of a mAb was \$96,731, exceeding \$100,000 for 34 mAb-indication combinations. Oncology and hematology mAbs represented 40\% of the mAb-indication combinations approved, yet they accounted for more than 85\% of those priced \$100,000 or higher. After adjusting for factors that can affect production costs, the annual price of oncology or hematology mAbs was \$149,622 higher than those used in cardiovascular or metabolic disorders; \$98,981 higher than in immunology; \$128,856 higher than in infectious diseases or allergy; and \$106,830 higher than in ophthalmology (all P {$<$}.001). CONCLUSIONS: The annual price of mAb therapies is about \$100,000 higher in oncology and hematology than in other disease states.},

To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development.},

  abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, synonymous codons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as codon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major cause for selection on codon bias is that certain preferred codons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes maybe even contradictory selective forces appear to affect codon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways in which natural selection participates in the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise several open questions: (i) Is natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred codons is weak only when codon bias approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong on genes with codon bias levels that are much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major codons? (iii) How do shifts in codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection on codon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on how they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

Importantly, recent advance in cancer research suggests that altering cancer cell bioenergetics can provide an effective way to target such advanced cancer cells that have acquired mutations in multiple cellular regulators. This study aims to identify bioenergetic alterations in lung cancer cells by directly measuring and comparing key metabolic activities in a pair of cell lines representing normal and NSCLC cells developed from the same patient. We found that the rates of oxygen consumption and heme biosynthesis were intensified in NSCLC cells. Additionally, the NSCLC cells exhibited substantially increased levels in an array of proteins promoting heme synthesis, uptake and function. These proteins include the rate-limiting heme biosynthetic enzyme ALAS, transporter proteins HRG1 and HCP1 that are involved in heme uptake, and various types of oxygen-utilizing hemoproteins such as cytoglobin and cytochromes. Several types of human tumor xenografts also displayed increased levels of such proteins. Furthermore, we found that lowering heme biosynthesis and uptake, like lowering mitochondrial respiration, effectively reduced oxygen consumption, cancer cell proliferation, migration and colony formation. In contrast, lowering heme degradation does not have an effect on lung cancer cells. These results show that increased heme flux and function are a key feature of NSCLC cells. Further, increased generation and supply of heme and oxygen-utilizing hemoproteins in cancer cells will lead to intensified oxygen consumption and cellular energy production by mitochondrial respiration, which would fuel cancer cell proliferation and progression. The results show that inhibiting heme and respiratory function can effectively arrest the progression of lung cancer cells. Hence, understanding heme function can positively impact on research in lung cancer biology and therapeutics.},

As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

Recently, several works proposed the use of an autoencoder--decoder, a symmetry neural network architecture, and non-negative matrix factorization methods to characterize the high-dimensional data. To evaluate the performance of multiple methods, in this work, we performed a multiple comparison for characterizing scATAC-seq based on four kinds of auto-encoders known as a symmetry neural network, and two kinds of matrix factorization methods. Different sizes of latent features were used to generate the UMAP plots and for further K-means clustering. Using a gold-standard data set, we practically explored the performance among the methods and the number of latent features in a comprehensive way. Finally, we briefly discuss the underlying difficulties and future directions for scATAC-seq characterizing. As a result, the method designed for handling the sparsity outperforms other tools in the generated dataset.},

In this work, we attempt to quantify the historical limits of acceptability for multiple biophysical metrics of "developability." Amino acid sequences from 137 antibodies in advanced clinical stages, including 48 approved for therapeutic use, were collected and used to construct isotype-matched IgG1 antibodies, which were then expressed in mammalian cells. The resulting material for each source antibody was evaluated in a dozen biophysical property assays. The distributions of the observed metrics are used to empirically define boundaries of drug-like behavior that can represent practical guidelines for future antibody drug candidates.}

Recent research trends have shown that the contextualized language models (e.g. BioBERT, BioELMo) possess tremendous representational power and are able to achieve impressive accuracy gains. However, these models are still unable to learn high-quality representations for concepts with low context information (i.e. rare words). Infusing the complementary information from knowledge-bases (KBs) is likely to be helpful when the corpus-specific information is insufficient to learn robust representations. Moreover, as the biomedical domain contains numerous KBs, it is imperative to develop approaches that can integrate the KBs in a continual fashion.We propose a new representation learning approach that progressively fuses the semantic information from multiple KBs into the pretrained biomedical language models. Since most of the KBs in the biomedical domain are expressed as parent-child hierarchies, we choose to model the hierarchical KBs and propose a new knowledge modeling strategy that encodes their topological properties at a granular level. Moreover, the proposed continual learning technique efficiently updates the concepts representations to accommodate the new knowledge while preserving the memory efficiency of contextualized language models. Altogether, the proposed approach generates knowledge-powered embeddings with high fidelity and learning efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on bioNLP tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed approach and demonstrates its capability in generating robust concept representations.}

Based on these types of expression data, various computational methods have been proposed to predict cancer subtypes. It is crucial to study how to better integrate these multiple profiles of data. In this paper, we collect multiple profiles of data for five cancers on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, we construct three similarity kernels for all patients of the same cancer by gene expression, miRNA expression and isoform expression data. We also propose a novel unsupervised multiple kernel fusion method, Similarity Kernel Fusion (SKF), in order to integrate three similarity kernels into one combined kernel. Finally, we make use of spectral clustering on the integrated kernel to predict cancer subtypes. In the experimental results, the P-values from the Cox regression model and survival curve analysis can be used to evaluate the performance of predicted subtypes on three datasets. Our kernel fusion method, SKF, has outstanding performance compared with single kernel and other multiple kernel fusion strategies. It demonstrates that our method can accurately identify more accurate subtypes on various kinds of cancers. Our cancer subtype prediction method can identify essential genes and biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, and we also discuss the possible side effects of therapies and treatment.}

However, DNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that's easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distribution datasets.It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also excels in the few-shot setting, where labeled data are too scarce to train DNNs effectively.}

  abstract = {The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.},

  abstract = {Similarity search finds application in specialized database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior GPU state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs. We have open-sourced our approach for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Globally, at least 27 novel antibody therapeutics are undergoing review by regulatory agencies. First actions by the Food and Drug Administration on the biologics license applications for faricimab, sutimlimab, tebentafusp, relatlimab, sintilimab, ublituximab and tezepelumab are expected in the first quarter of 2022.

In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

The fusion protein encoded by BCR-ABL possesses an aberrantly regulated tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571) is an inhibitor of ABL tyrosine kinase activity that has been remarkably effective in slowing disease progression in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, but the emergence of imatinib resistance underscores the need for additional therapies. Targeting signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL is a promising approach for drug development. The study of signaling components downstream of BCR-ABL and the related murine oncogene v-Abl has revealed a complex web of signals that promote cell division and survival. Of these, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has emerged as one of the essential signaling mechanisms in ABL leukemogenesis. This review describes molecular mechanisms by which PI3K is activated and the downstream PI3K effectors that propagate the signal to promote myeloid and lymphoid transformation. Of particular recent interest is the mammalian target of rapamycin, a PI3K-regulated kinase that regulates protein synthesis and contributes to leukemogenesis.}

Here, we examine four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter and two in the first intron of CDKN1A for association with SLE susceptibility. A comparison of 742 Korean SLE patients with 1017 controls disclosed that one SNP (rs762624 C{$>$}A at position -899), located at a putative Myb-binding site in the promoter, was associated with SLE susceptibility (P=0.00047). This association was independent of the SLE-association signal of HLA-DRB1 on 6p21.3, as it was significant after adjustment for SLE-risk DRB1 alleles (P=0.0012). The same SNP was associated with lupus nephritis (P=0.000014). The risk allele-carrying promoter sequence displayed {$\sim$}15\% lower activity than the non-risk sequence upon fusion to the luciferase gene (P=0.025). Endogenous CDKN1A mRNA levels measured in Epstein--Barr virus-transformed B cells established from 16 control subjects were linearly correlated with a decreasing copy number of the risk allele (P=0.024). Accordingly, we conclude that the minor allele A at -899 of CDKN1A is associated with increased susceptibility to SLE and lupus nephritis, and decreased cellular levels of p21.},

  abstract = {Background Biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response are urgently needed for patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Activity-based nanosensors, an emerging biosensor class, detect dysregulated proteases in vivo and release a reporter to provide a urinary readout of disease. Because proteases are dysregulated in LAM and may directly contribute to lung function decline, activity-based nanosensors may enable quantitative, real-time monitoring of LAM progression and treatment response. We aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of activity-based nanosensors in a pre-clinical model of pulmonary LAM. Methods Tsc2-null cells were injected intravenously into female nude mice to establish a mouse model of pulmonary LAM. A library of 14 activity-based nanosensors, designed to detect proteases across multiple catalytic classes, was administered into the lungs of LAM mice and healthy controls, urine was collected, and mass spectrometry was performed to measure nanosensor cleavage products. Mice were then treated with rapamycin and monitored with activity-based nanosensors. Machine learning was performed to distinguish diseased from healthy and treated from untreated mice. Results Multiple activity-based nanosensors (PP03 (cleaved by metallo, aspartic and cysteine proteases), padjusted{$<$}0.0001; PP10 (cleaved by serine, aspartic and cysteine proteases), padjusted=0.017)) were differentially cleaved in diseased and healthy lungs, enabling strong classification with a machine learning model (area under the curve (AUC) 0.95 from healthy). Within 2 days after rapamycin initiation, we observed normalisation of PP03 and PP10 cleavage, and machine learning enabled accurate classification of treatment response (AUC 0.94 from untreated). Conclusions Activity-based nanosensors enable noninvasive, real-time monitoring of disease burden and treatment response in a pre-clinical model of LAM.

We describe here an approach to pharmacologically interrogate the PI3-K family. A chemically diverse panel of PI3-K inhibitors was synthesized, and their target selectivity was biochemically enumerated, revealing cryptic homologies across targets and chemotypes. Crystal structures of three inhibitors bound to p110{$\gamma$} identify a conformationally mobile region that is uniquely exploited by selective compounds. This chemical array was then used to define the PI3-K isoforms required for insulin signaling. We find that p110{$\alpha$} is the primary insulin-responsive PI3-K in cultured cells, whereas p110{$\beta$} is dispensable but sets a phenotypic threshold for p110{$\alpha$} activity. Compounds targeting p110{$\alpha$} block the acute effects of insulin treatment in vivo, whereas a p110{$\beta$} inhibitor has no effect.

  abstract = {Traditional curriculum for teaching bonding often fosters the use of over-simplifications and over-generalizations. Therefore, there is a need for a presentation that is consistent with current scientific knowledge and that provides the student with the proper intellectual infrastructure for further studies. In this article, we present a general framework for bonding that can be presented at different levels of sophistication depending on the student's level and needs. This is achieved without sacrificing the benefits of traditional qualification of different bond types as this qualification is presented along a continuum scale of chemical bonding. The pedagogical strategy for teaching this model is a "bottom-up" one, starting with basic principles and ending with specific properties. It is our hope that its use could remove learning impediments and enhance students understanding of the nature of chemical bonds.}

  abstract = {Subword units are an effective way to alleviate the open vocabulary problems in neural machine translation (NMT). While sentences are usually converted into unique subword sequences, subword segmentation is potentially ambiguous and multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to harness the segmentation ambiguity as a noise to improve the robustness of NMT. We present a simple regularization method, subword regularization, which trains the model with multiple subword segmentations probabilistically sampled during training. In addition, for better subword sampling, we propose a new subword segmentation algorithm based on a unigram language model. We experiment with multiple corpora and report consistent improvements especially on low resource and out-of-domain settings.},

It provides open-source C++ and Python implementations for subword units. While existing subword segmentation tools assume that the input is pre-tokenized into word sequences, SentencePiece can train subword models directly from raw sentences, which allows us to make a purely end-to-end and language independent system. We perform a validation experiment of NMT on English-Japanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy to direct subword training from raw sentences.

Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local co-occurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.},

However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity---the time derivative of the gene expression state---can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

We further increase the throughput of this platform by combining it with combinatorial indexing (dsciATAC-seq), enabling single-cell studies at a massive scale. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by measuring chromatin accessibility across 136,463 resting and stimulated human bone marrow-derived cells to reveal changes in the cis- and trans-regulatory landscape across cell types and under stimulatory conditions at single-cell resolution.

Given the continued advances in DNA sequencing technologies, efficient methods for measuring statistically significant relationships between many sets of genomic features are crucial for future discovery.Results: We introduce the Binary Interval Search (BITS) algorithm, a novel and scalable approach to interval set intersection. We demonstrate that BITS outperforms existing methods at counting interval intersections. Moreover, we show that BITS is intrinsically suited to parallel computing architectures, such as graphics processing units by illustrating its utility for efficient Monte Carlo simulations measuring the significance of relationships between sets of genomic intervals.Availability: ~https://github.com/arq5x/bits.Contact: ~arq5x@virginia.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the  input to be represented as a fixed length feature  vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most  common representations is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words models have  two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering  of the words and they also ignore semantics of  the words. For example, "powerful," "strong"  and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper,  we propose an unsupervised algorithm that learns  vector representations of sentences and text documents. This algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict  words in the document. Its construction gives our  algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that our technique outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for  text representations. Finally, we achieve new  state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

CAI is a geometric mean of the relative usage of codons in a gene, and is calculated using the codon usage table trained with a set of highly expressed genes. In contrast, rCAI is computed by subtracting the background codon usage trained with two noncoding frames of highly expressed genes from the codon usage in the coding frame. rCAI has higher signal-to-noise ratio than CAI, considering that noncoding frames would not show codon bias. Translation efficiency and protein abundance correlates comparably or better with rCAI than CAI or other measures such as `effective number of codons' and `SCUMBLE offsets'. Within overlapping coding regions, one of the two coding frames dominates in codon usage bias according to rCAI. Presumably, rCAI could substitute CAI in diverse applications.},

The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set. We show that our model is theoretically attractive and we evaluate it on a range of tasks, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods for set-structured data.},

It has been a key kernel for many applications for a long time. However, it is becoming especially more important in recent days as modern neural networks and machine learning models represent the semantics of images, videos, and documents as high-dimensional vectors called embeddings. Finding a set of similar embeddings for the provided query embedding is now the critical operation for modern recommender systems and semantic search engines. Since exhaustively searching for the most similar vectors out of billion vectors is such a prohibitive task, approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is often utilized in many real-world use cases. Unfortunately, we find that utilizing the server-class CPUs and GPUs for the ANNS task leads to suboptimal performance and energy efficiency. To address such limitations, we propose a specialized architecture named ANNA (Approximate Nearest Neighbor search Accelerator), which is compatible with state-of-the-art ANNS algorithms such as Google ScaNN and Facebook Faiss. By combining the benefits of a specialized dataflow pipeline and efficient data reuse, ANNA achieves multiple orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency, 2.3-61.6{\texttimes} higher throughput, and 4.3-82.1{\texttimes} lower latency than the conventional CPU or GPU for both million- and billion-scale datasets.},

Our multiomics data integration provides cell type annotation of 128,724 cis-regulatory elements (cREs) and uncovers cell type--specific dysregulations in cREs with a strong transcriptional influence on genes implicated in PD. The establishment of high-resolution three-dimensional chromatin contact maps identifies 656 target genes of dysregulated cREs and genetic risk loci, uncovering both potential and known PD risk genes. Notably, these candidate genes exhibit modular gene expression patterns with unique molecular signatures in distinct cell types, highlighting altered molecular mechanisms in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells including oligodendrocytes and microglia. Together, our single-cell transcriptome and epigenome reveal cell type--specific disruption in transcriptional regulations related to PD.}

Here we present an antibody-specific language model, AntiBERTa, which provides a contextualised representation of BCR sequences. Following pre-training, we show that AntiBERTa embeddings learn biologically relevant information, generalizable to a range of applications. As a case study, we demonstrate how AntiBERTa can be fine-tuned to predict paratope positions from an antibody sequence, outperforming public tools across multiple metrics. To our knowledge, AntiBERTa is the deepest protein family-specific language model, providing a rich representation of BCRs. AntiBERTa embeddings are primed for multiple downstream tasks and can improve our understanding of the language of antibodies.},

Metadata provide context and provenance to raw data and methods and are essential to both discovery and validation.

This review employs a functional content analysis to identify metadata standards that support reproducibility across an analytic stack consisting of input data, tools, notebooks, pipelines, and publications.

It seeks to swap synonymous codons in a recombinant gene to reflect the specific codon usage bias of the expression system. While many tools for codon optimization exist, they cannot optimize a single gene for expression in multiple species and are typically limited in their ability to process large sets of genes. Additionally, these tools often only provide a single interface for running optimizations, making them incompatible with existing bioinformatics tools and pipelines. To address these shortcomings we created Optipyzer: an online codon optimization web server with an accompanying web interface and Python package for multi-species codon optimizations. Optipyzer was designed to be fast, flexible, and extensible - providing numerous interfaces for query submission. We believe that Optipyzer can be a powerful tool for the modern biologist by seamlessly integrating into any workflow. The main web interface can be accessed at https://optipyzer.com.},

One major computational challenge is dealing with high dimensionality and inherent sparsity, which is typically addressed by producing lower dimensional representations of single cells for downstream clustering tasks. Current approaches produce such individual cell embeddings directly through a one-step learning process. Here, we propose an alternative approach by building embedding models pre-trained on reference data. We argue that this provides a more flexible analysis workflow that also has computational performance advantages through transfer learning. We implemented our approach in scEmbed, an unsupervised machine-learning framework that learns low-dimensional embeddings of genomic regulatory regions to represent and analyze scATAC-seq data. scEmbed performs well in terms of clustering ability and has the key advantage of learning patterns of region co-occurrence that can be transferred to other, unseen datasets. Moreover, models pre-trained on reference data can be exploited to build fast and accurate cell-type annotation systems without the need for other data modalities. scEmbed is implemented in Python and it is available to download from GitHub. We also make our pre-trained models available on huggingface for public use. scEmbed is open source and available at https://github.com/databio/geniml.

  abstract = {Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) are the key effectors of eukaryotic gene control and they regulate hundreds to thousands of downstream genes. Of particular interest are interactions in which a given TF regulates other TFs; these interactions define the TF regulatory networks (TRNs) that underlie cellular identity and major function. Chromatin accessibility depicts whether or not a DNA sequence is physically accessible and provides a direct measurement of transcriptional regulation. Benefiting from the accumulating chromatin accessibility data and deep learning advances, we developed a new computational method named DeepTFni to infer TRNs from the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data. By implementing a graph neural network, which is more suitable for network representation, DeepTFni shows outstanding performance in TRN inference, which it supports with limited numbers of cells. Furthermore, by applying DeepTFni we identified hub TFs in tissue development and tumorigenesis and revealed that many mixed-phenotype acute leukemia associated genes undergo a prominent alteration to the TRN while there is moderate difference in messenger RNA level. The DeepTFni webserver is easy to use and has provided the predicted TRNs for several popular cell lines.},

  abstract = {We present modality gap, an intriguing geometric phenomenon of the representation space of multi-modal models. Specifically, we show that different data modalities (e.g. images and text) are embedded at arm's length in their shared representation in multi-modal models such as CLIP. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that this gap is caused by a combination of model initialization and contrastive learning optimization. In model initialization, we show empirically and theoretically that the representation of a common deep neural network is restricted to a narrow cone. As a consequence, in a multi-modal model with two encoders, the representations of the two modalities are clearly apart when the model is initialized. During optimization, contrastive learning keeps the different modalities separate by a certain distance, which is influenced by the temperature parameter in the loss function. Our experiments further demonstrate that varying the modality gap distance has a significant impact in improving the model's downstream zero-shot classification performance and fairness.

While hypervariable regions of antibodies, which are responsible for binding, can be readily identified from their amino acid sequence, it remains challenging to accurately pinpoint which amino acids will be in contact with the antigen (the paratope). Results: In this work, we present a sequence-based probabilistic machine learning algorithm for paratope prediction, named Parapred. Parapred uses a deep-learning architecture to leverage features from both local residue neighbourhoods and across the entire sequence. The method significantly improves on the current state-of-the-art methodology, and only requires a stretch of amino acid sequence corresponding to a hypervariable region as an input, without any information about the antigen. We further show that our predictions can be used to improve both speed and accuracy of a rigid docking algorithm.

Oncogenic activation of intracellular signalling pathways downstream of EGFR has a major role in colorectal carcinogenesis but has also been reported to be an important mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. Among the activating mutations found in colorectal cancers, tumour KRAS mutations, which are found in {$\sim$}40\% of the cases, have been widely demonstrated as a major predictive marker of resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab, therefore, opening the way to individualized treatment for patients with mCRC. Other oncogenic mutations, such as BRAF or PIK3CA mutations or loss of PTEN expression, may also be additional interesting predictive markers of response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies but required further evaluation before being incorporated in clinical practice. The identification of these molecular markers involved in the resistance of anti-EGFR antibodies will allow the development of new therapies that should target `escape mechanisms' used by tumours to circumvent a pathway that has been pharmacologically blocked by anti-EGFR.},

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

Using atlas data as well as multimodal datasets generated with ASAP-seq and CITE-seq, we demonstrate that scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves substantially higher cell-type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold alignment algorithm, MMD-MA, for integrating multiple measurements carried out on disjoint aliquots of a given population of cells. Effectively, MMD-MA performs an in silico co-assay by embedding cells measured in different ways into a learned latent space. In the MMD-MA algorithm, single-cell data points from multiple domains are aligned by optimizing an objective function with three components: (1) a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) term to encourage the differently measured points to have similar distributions in the latent space, (2) a distortion term to preserve the structure of the data between the input space and the latent space, and (3) a penalty term to avoid collapse to a trivial solution. Notably, MMD-MA does not require any correspondence information across data modalities, either between the cells or between the features. Furthermore, MMD-MA's weak distributional requirements for the domains to be aligned allow the algorithm to integrate heterogeneous types of single cell measures, such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, chromatin organization, methylation, and imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of MMD-MA in simulation experiments and using a real data set involving single-cell gene expression and methylation data.},

RESULTS: Here, we present Ens-Grad, a machine learning method that can design complementarity determining regions of human Immunoglobulin G antibodies with target affinities that are superior to candidates derived from phage display panning experiments. We also demonstrate that machine learning can improve target specificity by the modular composition of models from different experimental campaigns, enabling a new integrative approach to improving target specificity. Our results suggest a new path for the discovery of therapeutic molecules by demonstrating that predictive and differentiable models of antibody binding can be learned from high-throughput experimental data without the need for target structural data.

In this paper, we introduce SIMSKIP, a novel contrastive learning framework that specifically refines input embeddings for downstream tasks. Unlike traditional unsupervised learning approaches, SIMSKIP takes advantage of the output embeddings of encoder models as its input. Through theoretical analysis, we provide evidence that applying SIMSKIP does not result in larger upper bounds on downstream task errors than those of the original embeddings, which serve as SIMSKIP's input. Experimental results on various open datasets demonstrate that the embeddings produced by SIMSKIP improve performance on downstream tasks.},

Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call ``reverse homology'', exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homolog from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.},

Single-cell measurement of chromatin accessibility (DNA), gene expression (RNA), and proteins has revealed rich cellular diversity across tissues, organisms, and disease states. However, single-cell data poses a unique set of challenges. A dataset may comprise millions of cells with tens of thousands of sparse features. Identifying biologically relevant signals from the background sources of technical noise requires innovation in predictive and representational learning. Furthermore, unlike in machine vision or natural language processing, biological ground truth is limited. Here we leverage recent advances in multi-modal single-cell technologies which, by simultaneously measuring two layers of cellular processing in each cell, provide ground truth analogous to language translation. We define three key tasks to predict one modality from another and learn integrated representations of cellular state.

Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. Invasive BCs comprise wide spectrum tumors that show a variation concerning their clinical presentation, behavior, and morphology.

  abstract = {Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e., BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical NLP tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98\%, 38.42\% and 40.76\% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks respectively, and 78.2\% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.

In the last few years, numerous pharmaceutical and biotech companies have established kinase high-throughput screening (HTS) programs, and the reagent and service industries for kinase assay platforms, kits, and profiling services have begun to thrive. Objective The plethora of different assay formats available today poses a great challenge to scientists who want to select a technology that will be cost efficient, convenient to use, and have low false positive and false negative rates. Methods In the current review, we summarize the most commonly used kinase assay methods in the drug discovery process, present the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods, and discuss the challenges of discovering kinase inhibitors by using these technologies. Conclusions The decision of selecting the assay formats for HTS or service platform for profiling should take into account not only the final goals of the screens but also the limitation of resources.},

Supervised celltyping methods have gained increasing popularity in single-cell RNA-seq data because of the superior performance and the availability of high-quality reference datasets. Recent technological advances in profiling chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution (scATAC-seq) have brought new insights to the understanding of epigenetic heterogeneity. With continuous accumulation of scATAC-seq datasets, supervised celltyping method specifically designed for scATAC-seq is in urgent need. Here we develop Cellcano, a computational method based on a two-round supervised learning algorithm to identify cell types from scATAC-seq data. The method alleviates the distributional shift between reference and target data and improves the prediction performance. After systematically benchmarking Cellcano on 50 well-designed celltyping tasks from various datasets, we show that Cellcano is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient.

Antigen-contacting propensities are presented for each antibody residue, allowing a new definition for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) to be proposed based on observed antigen contacts. Contacts are more common at CDR residues which are located centrally within the combining site; some less central CDR residues are only contacted by large antigens. Non-contacting residues within the CDRs coincide with residues identified by Chothia and co-workers as important in defining "canonical" conformations. An objective means of classifying protein surfaces by gross topography has been developed and applied to the antibody combining site surfaces. The surfaces have been clustered into four topographic classes: concave and moderately concave (mostly hapten binders), ridged (mostly peptide binders) and planar (mostly protein binders). We have determined the topographic classes for ten pairs of complexed and uncomplexed antibody-antigen crystal structures; four change topographic class on complexation. The results will be of use in antibody engineering, antigen docking and in clinical immunology. To demonstrate one application, we show how the data can be used to locate the antigen binding pocket on antibody structures.},

Viewing amino acid sequences as a language, we demonstrate that a deep learning-based language model can generate functional artificial protein sequences across families, akin to generating grammatically and semantically correct natural language sentences on diverse topics. Our protein language model is trained by simply learning to predict the next amino acid for over 280 million protein sequences from thousands of protein families, without biophysical or coevolutionary modeling. We experimentally evaluate model-generated artificial proteins on five distinct antibacterial lysozyme families. Artificial proteins show similar activities and catalytic efficiencies as representative natural lysozymes, including hen egg white lysozyme, while reaching as low as 44\% identity to any known naturally-evolved protein. The X-ray crystal structure of an enzymatically active artificial protein recapitulates the conserved fold and positioning of active site residues found in natural proteins. We demonstrate our language model's ability to be adapted to different protein families by accurately predicting the functionality of artificial chorismate mutase and malate dehydrogenase proteins. These results indicate that neural language models successfully perform de novo protein generation across protein families and may prove to be a tool to shortcut evolution.},

The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for additional search structures, which are typically used at the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph techniques. Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a multi-layer structure consisting from hierarchical set of proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling. Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed implementation.},

Any human protein can now be identified directly from genome databases on the basis of minimal data derived by mass spectrometry. As has already happened in genomics, increased automation of sample handling, analysis, and the interpretation of results will generate an avalanche of qualitative and quantitative proteomic data. Protein-protein interactions can be analyzed directly by precipitation of a tagged bait followed by mass spectrometric identification of its binding partners. By these and similar strategies, entire protein complexes, signaling pathways, and whole organelles are being characterized. Posttranslational modifications remain difficult to analyze but are starting to yield to generic strategies.},

We identify 518 putative protein kinase genes, of which 71 have not previously been reported or described as kinases, and we extend or correct the protein sequences of 56 more kinases. New genes include members of well-studied families as well as previously unidentified families, some of which are conserved in model organisms. Classification and comparison with model organism kinomes identified orthologous groups and highlighted expansions specific to human and other lineages.

Here, we use deep learning to interrogate and predict antigen-specificity from a massively diverse sequence space to identify globally optimized antibody variants. Using a mammalian display platform and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, rationally designed site-directed mutagenesis libraries are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Screening and deep sequencing of relatively small libraries (10             4             ) produced high quality data capable of training deep neural networks that accurately predict antigen-binding based on antibody sequence. Deep learning is then used to predict millions of antigen binders from an             in silico             library of {\textasciitilde}10             8             variants, where experimental testing of 30 randomly selected variants showed all 30 retained antigen specificity. The full set of             in silico             predicted binders is then subjected to multiple developability filters, resulting in thousands of highly-optimized lead candidates. With its scalability and capacity to interrogate high-dimensional protein sequence space, deep learning offers great potential for antibody engineering and optimization.},

Importantly, this approach can be performed in~vitro, in~situ, or in~vivo. It has been successfully applied to identify targets and off-targets of drugs, or to study protein?metabolite and protein?protein interactions. Therefore, TPP provides a unique insight into protein state and interactions in their native context and at a proteome-wide level, allowing to study basic biological processes and their underlying mechanisms.},

Equilibrium binding ligands increase protein thermal stability by an amount proportional to the concentration and affinity of the ligand. Binding constants (Kb) were measured by examining the systematic effect of ligand concentration on protein stability. The precise ligand effects depend on the thermodynamics of protein stability:\, in particular, the unfolding enthalpy. An extension of current theoretical treatments was developed for tight binding inhibitors, where ligand effect on Tm can also reveal binding stoichiometry. A thermodynamic analysis of carbonic anhydrase by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) enabled a dissection of the Gibbs free energy of stability into enthalpic and entropic components. Under certain conditions, thermal stability increased by over 30 {$^\circ$}C; the heat capacity of protein unfolding was estimated from the dependence of calorimetric enthalpy on Tm. The binding affinity of six sulfonamide inhibitors to two isozymes (human type 1 and bovine type 2) was analyzed by both ThermoFluor and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), resulting in a good correlation in the rank ordering of ligand affinity. This combined investigation by ThermoFluor, ITC, and DSC provides a detailed picture of the linkage between ligand binding and protein stability. The systematic effect of ligands on stability is shown to be a general tool to measure affinity.}

  abstract = {Alectinib (Alecensa{\textregistered}) is a second-generation, orally active, potent and highly selective inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Alectinib is approved for the treatment of ALK fusion-gene positive, unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan, where it has been given orphan drug designation. Approval was based on a phase 1--2 study in ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC who received twice-daily alectinib 300~mg. In the phase 2 portion, 93.5~\% of patients achieved an objective response. Treatment response was rapid, with a partial response achieved in two-thirds of patients within 3~weeks (cycle 1). Patient follow-up is ongoing, and after approximately 2~years, 19.6~\% of patients had achieved a complete response, and the 2-year progression-free survival rate is 76~\%. During treatment with alectinib (median follow-up approximately 8~months), there was no progression of CNS lesions among patients with known CNS metastases at baseline (although prior radiation therapy may have confounded results). In preclinical models, alectinib was active against most ALK fusion-gene mutations related to crizotinib resistance, and preliminary results from clinical trials indicate efficacy in crizotinib-refractory NSCLC. Alectinib was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, and there were no treatment-related grade 4 adverse events or deaths. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were decreased neutrophil counts and increased creatinine phosphokinase. While more data are needed to confirm the efficacy of alectinib and to evaluate its activity in crizotinib-resistant disease, the drug provides a very promising option for the treatment of ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC.},

Here we describe a robotic system, termed the automated compound profiler, capable of both propagating a large number of cell lines in parallel and assaying large collections of molecules simultaneously against a matrix of cellular assays in a highly reproducible manner. To illustrate its utility, we have characterized a set of 1,400 kinase inhibitors in a panel of 35 activated tyrosine-kinase-dependent cellular assays in dose--response format in a single experiment. Analysis of the resulting multidimensional dataset revealed subclusters of both inhibitors and kinases with closely correlated activities. The approach also identified activities for the p38 inhibitor BIRB796 and the dual src/abl inhibitor BMS-354825 and exposed the expected side activities for Glivec/STI571, including cellular inhibition of c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. This methodology provides a powerful tool for unraveling the cellular biology and molecular pharmacology of both naturally occurring and synthetic chemical diversity.}

  abstract = {Antibodies comprise the most versatile class of binding molecules, with numerous applications in biomedicine. Therapeutic antibody development requires designing novel and diverse sequences with improved properties, while maintaining the structural consistency. Recently, deep language models and graph neural networks have shown impressive success in antibody sequence generation. Since only a limited number of antibody structures are known, training a model using this limited data can lead to degraded performance, particularly lacking diversity in the generated samples. To address such issues, we leverage the method of Model Reprogramming (MR), which focuses on repurposing pretrained machine learning models for target domain tasks with scarce data, where it may be difficult to train a high-performing model from scratch. We introduce Reprogramming for Protein Sequence Infilling, a framework in which pretrained natural language models are repurposed for protein sequence infilling via reprogramming, to infill protein sequence templates as a method of novel protein generation. For variable CDR sequence design, we formulate the task as text infilling that uses the constant region of an antibody as the sequence template. Results on antibody design benchmarks show that our reprogrammed model on low resourced antibody sequence dataset provides highly diverse CDR sequences, up to more than a two-fold increase of diversity over the baselines, without losing structural integrity and naturalness. The performance benefit of the reprogrammed model learning only from antibody sequences is more evident for longer CDR design or for multiple loop infilling at once, compared to existing graph-based models that require additional structural information. The generated sequences also demonstrate enhanced antigen binding specificity or virus neutralization ability.},

  abstract = {Chromatin accessibility profiling methods such as assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) have been promoting the identification of gene regulatory elements and the characterization of epigenetic landscapes. Unlike gene expression data, there is no consistent reference for chromatin accessibility data, which hinders large-scale integration analysis. By analyzing many more than 1000 ATAC-seq samples and 100 scATAC-seq samples, we found that cells share the same set of potential open regions. We thus proposed a reference called consensus peaks (cPeaks) to represent open regions across different cell types, and developed a deep-learning model to predict all potential open regions in the human genome. We showed that cPeaks can be regarded as a new set of epigenomic elements in the human genome, and using cPeaks can increase the performance of cell annotations and facilitate the discovery of rare cell types. cPeaks also performed well in analyzing dynamic biological processes and diseases. cPeaks can serve as a general reference for epigenetic studies, much like the reference genome for genomic studies, making the research faster, more accurate, and more scalable.},

The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their RNA capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.},

  abstract = {Mammalian lungs are branched networks containing thousands to millions of airways arrayed in intricate patterns that are crucial for respiration. How such trees are generated during development, and how the developmental patterning information is encoded, have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. However, models have been limited by a lack of information on the normal sequence and pattern of branching events. Here we present the complete three-dimensional branching pattern and lineage of the mouse bronchial tree, reconstructed from an analysis of hundreds of developmental intermediates. The branching process is remarkably stereotyped and elegant: the tree is generated by three geometrically simple local modes of branching used in three different orders throughout the lung. We propose that each mode of branching is controlled by a genetically encoded subroutine, a series of local patterning and morphogenesis operations, which are themselves controlled by a more global master routine. We show that this hierarchical and modular programme is genetically tractable, and it is ideally suited to encoding and evolving the complex networks of the lung and other branched organs.},

We use a standard Vision Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, contrastive image-text pre-training, and end-to-end detection fine-tuning. Our analysis of the scaling properties of this setup shows that increasing image-level pre-training and model size yield consistent improvements on the downstream detection task. We provide the adaptation strategies and regularizations needed to attain very strong performance on zero-shot text-conditioned and one-shot image-conditioned object detection.

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory process driven by plaque formation in the major elastic arteries and often leads to reduced blood flow, coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction and stroke. CAD progression involves complex interactions and phenotypic plasticity within and between distinct vascular and immune cell lineages. Several single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies have highlighted lineage-specific transcriptomic signatures however there remains variability on the reported cell phenotypes in humans. In this study we meta-analyzed scRNA-seq datasets across four publications to create a comprehensive map of human atherosclerosis cell diversity. We applied standardized QC, processing, and integration benchmarking to harmonize 118,578 high-quality cells for this atlas. Beyond characterizing vascular and immune cell diversity, we derived insights into smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic modulation through pseudotime, transcription factor activity inference and cell-cell communication analyses. We also integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to identify etiologic cell types for GWAS diseases and traits, which uncovered a critical role for modulated SMC phenotypes in CAD and coronary artery calcification. Finally, we identified candidate markers (e.g., CRTAC1) of synthetic and osteochondrogenic SMCs that may serve as proxies of atherosclerosis progression. Together, this represents an important step towards creating a unified cellular map of atherosclerosis to inform cell state-specific mechanistic and translational studies of cardiovascular diseases.},

It is unclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking. This makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are constantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding method dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to converge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to provide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks. MTEB comes with open-source code and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.},

  abstract = {One of the ubiquitous representation of long DNA sequence is dividing it into shorter k-mer components. Unfortunately, the straightforward vector encoding of k-mer as a one-hot vector is vulnerable to the curse of dimensionality. Worse yet, the distance between any pair of one-hot vectors is equidistant. This is particularly problematic when applying the latest machine learning algorithms to solve problems in biological sequence analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train distributed representations of variable-length k-mers. Our method is based on the popular word embedding model word2vec, which is trained on a shallow two-layer neural network. Our experiments provide evidence that the summing of dna2vec vectors is akin to nucleotides concatenation. We also demonstrate that there is correlation between Needleman-Wunsch similarity score and cosine similarity of dna2vec vectors.},

  abstract = {Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context ({$<$}0.001\% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyenas new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level, an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics for simple adaptation to novel tasks without updating pretrained model weights. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 17 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on all 8 datasets on average by +9 accuracy points.},

Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement---a term not defined consistently in past work---as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences.},

Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.},

These enhancer sequences are further marked by combinatorial patterns of histone modification or occupancy by CBP or p300, indicative of their context-dependent function.The presence of H3K27ac (histone 3 acetylated at lysine 27) or H3K27me3 (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27) specifies whether an enhancer is active or poised for activation, respectively.Extensive intra- and interchromosomal interactions between enhancers and promoters are detected at many co-regulated genes during development.Chromatin looping between enhancer and promoter are in part mediated by the interaction between specific transcription factors, CCCTC-binding factor, mediator and/or the cohesin complex.Transcription of long intergenic ncRNAs from some enhancers can regulate expression of their neighbouring genes by targeting specific chromatin modifying factors to their promoter regions.The FOS-like antigen 1 (FOSL1) enhancer appears to facilitate the recruitment of histone-modifying complexes that trigger RNA polymerase II release from promoter-proximal pausing, rather than initiation, and productive transcription from its cognate promoter.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Members of the human protein kinase superfamily are the major regulatory enzymes involved in the activity control of eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. As protein kinases reside at the nodes of phosphorylation-based signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and site-specific phosphorylation can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling networks. However, in global proteome studies, low cellular abundance of protein kinases often results in rather minor peptide species that are occluded by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular proteins. These analytical limitations create a rationale for kinome-wide enrichment of protein kinases prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to compare the binding characteristics of three kinase-selective affinity resins by quantitative mass spectrometry. The evaluated pre-fractionation tools possessed pyrido[2,3-\emph{d}]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors as immobilized capture ligands and retained considerable subsets of the human kinome. Based on these results, an affinity resin displaying the broadly selective kinase ligand VI16832 was employed to quantify the relative expression of more than 170 protein kinases across three different, SILAC-encoded cancer cell lines. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative kinome profiling in a compact experimental format. Interestingly, we found high levels of cytoplasmic and low levels of receptor tyrosine kinases in MV4--11 leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines HCT116 and MDA-MB-435S. The VI16832 resin was further exploited to pre-fractionate kinases for targeted phosphoproteomics analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct phosphorylation sites on more than 200 protein kinases. This hitherto largest survey of site-specific phosphorylation across the kinome significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein kinase regulation. In conclusion, the straightforward experimental procedures described here enable different implementations of kinase-selective proteomics with considerable potential for future signal transduction and kinase drug target analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

The folded state is stabilized mainly by the burial and tight packing of over 80\% of the peptide groups and non-polar side chains. If life as we know it is to exist in a solvent other than water, the folded state must be stable and soluble in the new solvent. Our analysis suggests that proteins will be unstable in most polar solvents such as ethanol, extremely stable in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane, and even more stable in a vacuum. Our solubility studies suggest that protein solubility will be markedly lower in polar solvents such as ethanol and that proteins will be essentially insoluble in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane.

Effector predictors utilizing pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) have shown sound performance by leveraging extensive evolutionary and sequential protein features. However, the accuracy and sensitivity of effector prediction remain challenging. Here, we introduce a model named Contrastive-learning of Language Embedding and Biological Features (CLEF) leveraging contrastive learning to integrate PLM representations with supplementary biological features. Biologically information is captured in learned contextualized embeddings to yield meaningful representations. With cross-modality biological features, CLEF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in predicting type III, type IV, and type VI secreted effectors (T3SEs/T4SEs/T6SEs) in enteric pathogens. All experimentally verified effectors in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and 41 of 43 experimentally verified T3SEs of Salmonella Typhimurium are recognized. Moreover, 12 predicted T3SEs and 11 predicted T6SEs are validated by extensive experiments in Edwardsiella piscicida. Furthermore, integrating omics data via CLEF framework enhances protein representations to illustrate effector-effector interactions and determine in vivo colonization-essential genes. Collectively, CLEF provides a blueprint to bridge the gap between in silico PLM's capacity and experimental biological information to fulfill complicated tasks.},

  abstract = {The genomic landscape of breast cancer is complex, and inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity are important challenges in treating the disease. In this study, we sequence 173 genes in 2,433 primary breast tumours that have copy number aberration (CNA), gene expression and long-term clinical follow-up data. We identify 40 mutation-driver (Mut-driver) genes, and determine associations between mutations, driver CNA profiles, clinical-pathological parameters and survival. We assess the clonal states of Mut-driver mutations, and estimate levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity using mutant-allele fractions. Associations between PIK3CA mutations and reduced survival are identified in three subgroups of ER-positive cancer (defined by amplification of 17q23, 11q13--14 or 8q24). High levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity are in general associated with a worse outcome, but highly aggressive tumours with 11q13--14 amplification have low levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity. These results emphasize the importance of genome-based stratification of breast cancer, and have important implications for designing therapeutic strategies.},

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be com pared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"-they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20\% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.},

Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis.},

Marker genes for a cell type, however, are highly correlated in bulk data, because their expression levels depend primarily on the proportion of that cell type in the samples. Therefore, when many tissue samples are analyzed, it is possible to identify these marker genes from the correlation pattern.To capitalize on this pattern, we develop a new algorithm to detect marker genes by combining published information about likely marker genes with bulk transcriptome data in the form of a semi-supervised algorithm. The algorithm then exploits the correlation structure of the bulk data to refine the published marker genes by adding or removing genes from the list.We implement this method as an R package markerpen, hosted on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markerpen).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

  abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as ques- tion answering, machine translation, reading com- prehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on task- specific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any ex- plicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the an- swers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and in- creasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested lan- guage modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain co- herent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language pro- cessing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.}

  abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).}

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

Current redox sensitive dyes and fluorescent proteins can quantify spatially distinct changes in reactive oxygen species levels, but multicolor probes are needed to accurately analyze compartment-specific redox dynamics in single cells that can be masked by population averaging. We previously engineered genetically encoded red-shifted redox-sensitive fluorescent protein sensors using a F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer relay strategy. Here, we developed a second-generation excitation ratiometric sensor called rogRFP2 with improved red emission for quantitative live-cell imaging. Using this sensor to measure activity-dependent redox changes in individual cultured neurons, we observed an anticorrelation in which mitochondrial oxidation was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the cytosol. This behavior was dependent on the activity of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and could be modulated by the presence of cocultured astrocytes. We also demonstrated that the red fluorescent rogRFP2 facilitates ratiometric one- and two-photon redox imaging in rat brain slices and Drosophila retinas. Overall, the proof-of-concept studies reported here demonstrate that this new rogRFP2 redox sensor can be a powerful tool for understanding redox biology both in vitro and in vivo across model organisms.}

  abstract = {With the advent of advanced molecular meta-omics techniques and methods, a new era commenced for analysing and characterizing historic collection specimens, as well as recently collected environmental samples. Nucleic acid and protein sequencing-based analyses are increasingly applied to determine the origin, identity and traits of environmental (biological) objects and organisms. In this context, the need for new data structures is evident and former approaches for data processing need to be expanded according to the new meta-omics techniques and operational standards. Existing schemas and community standards in the biodiversity and molecular domain concentrate on terms important for data exchange and publication. Detailed operational aspects of origin and laboratory as well as object and data management issues are frequently neglected. Meta-omics Data and Collection Objects (MOD-CO) has therefore been set up as a new schema for meta-omics research, with a hierarchical organization of the concepts describing collection samples, as well as products and data objects being generated during operational workflows. It is focussed on object trait descriptions as well as on operational aspects and thereby may serve as a backbone for R\&amp;D laboratory information management systems with functions of an electronic laboratory notebook. The schema in its current version 1.0 includes 653 concepts and 1810 predefined concept values, being equivalent to descriptors and descriptor states, respectively. It is published in several representations, like a Semantic Media Wiki publication with 2463 interlinked Wiki pages for concepts and concept values, being grouped in 37 concept collections and subcollections. The SQL database application DiversityDescriptions, a generic tool for maintaining descriptive data and schemas, has been applied for setting up and testing MOD-CO and for concept mapping on elements of corresponding schemas.}

  abstract = {Purpose Anatomy is a challenging course in medical school, in part because of the vast number of facts that must be memorized. Current literature suggests the value of spaced repetition in the learning of factual information, and online tools such as Anki flashcards have been developed to facilitate it. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of curriculum-specific Anki flashcards as a study tool for first year medical students learning anatomy. Methods A set of Anki flashcards was created for the anatomy thread of Block 1 (back, pectoral, shoulder, vertebral regions) and Block 3A (cardiac \& pulmonary regions) of the JeffMD curriculum at Sidney Kimmel Medical College. Upon completion of an initial survey, study volunteers were provided with the curriculum-specific flashcards. Following the anatomy exam in each block, another survey was administered to gather data regarding participants' usage and opinions of the flashcards. Results and Conclusions 148 students completed the initial survey and were provided with the flashcards. Of the 78 students that used the curriculum-specific flashcards and completed the post-exam survey in Block 1, 20.5\% found them extremely helpful, 29.5\% very helpful, 33.3\% moderately helpful, 15.4\% slightly helpful, and 1.3\% not at all helpful. Furthermore, 60.3\% believed that the flashcards helped reduce anxiety related to the anatomy, while 18.0\% did not believe that they reduced anxiety. Of the 60 students that used the curriculum-specific flashcards and completed the post-exam survey in Block 3A, 41.7\% found them extremely helpful, 36.7\% very helpful, 11.7\% moderately helpful, and 10.0\% slightly helpful. Moreover, 76.7\% believed that the flashcards helped reduce anxiety related to the anatomy, while 15.0\% did not believe that they reduced anxiety. These results suggest that spaced repetition of anatomy facts through curriculum-specific Anki flashcards may have a positive impact on affective learning outcomes among first year medical students.

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

  abstract = {Understanding the pathogenesis of SLE remains a considerable challenge. Multiple abnormalities of both the innate and adaptive immune system have been described and, furthermore, immunological dysfunction precedes clinical presentation by many years. There is a strong genetic basis to SLE, which means that genetic studies can play a key role in furthering our understanding of this disease. Since susceptibility variants are present from birth and are unaffected by the course of the disease, or by its treatment, genetic analysis is, perhaps uniquely, capable of identifying fundamental, causative, disease mechanisms. Over the last 12 months, there has been a staggering increase in our understanding of SLE genetics. We have seen the identification of new and important SLE susceptibility genes through candidate gene studies, and we have seen the publication of two whole-genome association analyses. The `hypothesis free' whole-genome studies have provided additional evidence in support of a number of existing susceptibility genes and have identified novel gene candidates. In this article, we review the current SLE genetics literature in the light of these recent advances and we discuss our current understanding of the functional role of the key susceptibility genes. By considering how these genes fall into clusters with shared function we can begin to understand how dysregulation at a number of key immunological steps may predispose to the development of SLE.}

Of the 34 loci known to contain STAT1 interferon-responsive binding sites, ChIP-seq found 24 (71\%). ChIP-seq targets were enriched in sequences similar to known STAT1 binding motifs. Comparisons with two ChIP-PCR data sets suggested that ChIP-seq sensitivity was between 70\% and 92\% and specificity was at least 95\%.},

  abstract = {We are working to develop a comprehensive dataset of surgical tools based on specialities, with a hierarchical structure -- speciality, pack, set and tool. We belive that this dataset can be useful for computer vision and deep learning research into surgical tool tracking, management and surgical training and audit. We have therefore created an initial dataset of surgical tool (instrument~ and implant) images, captured using under different lighting conditions and with different backgrounds. We captured RGB images of surgical tools using a DSLR camera and webcam on site in a major hospital under realistic conditions and with the surgical tools currently in use. Image backgrounds in our initial dataset were essentially flat colours, even though different colour backgrounds were used. As we further developed our dataset, we will try to include much greater occlusions, illumination changes, and the presence of blood, tissue and smoke in the images which would be more reflective of crowded, messy, real-world conditions. Illumination sources included natural light -- direct sunlight and shaded light -- LED, halogen and fluorescent lighting, and this accurately reflected the illumination working conditions within the hospital. Distances of the surgical tools to the camera to the object ranged from 60 to 150 cms., and the average class size was 74 images. Images captured included individual object images as well as cluttered, clustered and occluded objects. Our initial focus was on Orthopaedics and General Surgery, two out of the 14 surgical specialities. We selected these specialities since general surgery instruments are the most commonly used tools across all surgeries and provide instrument volume, while orthopaedics provides variety and complexity given the wide range of procedures, instruments and implants used in orthopaedic surgery. We will add other specialities as we develop this dataset, to reflect the complexities inherent in each of the surgical specialities. This dataset was designed to offer a large variety of tools, arranged hierarchically to reflect how surgical tools are organised in real-world conditions.

Running economy is improved by performing combined endurance training with either heavy or explosive strength training. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. Concurrent endurance and heavy strength training can increase running speed and power output at VO2max (Vmax and Wmax, respectively) or time to exhaustion at Vmax and Wmax. Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. It is suggested that the improved endurance performance may relate to delayed activation of less efficient type II fibers, improved neuromuscular efficiency, conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibers into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, or improved musculo-tendinous stiffness.},

The data from each single cell is sparse, comprising on the order of 1000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of sub-populations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data.

Herein, we present a new thermal shift-based method, termed matrix thermal shift assay (mTSA), for fast deconvolution of ligand-binding targets and binding affinities at the proteome level. In mTSA, a sample matrix, treated horizontally with five different compound concentrations and vertically with five technical replicates of each condition, was denatured at a single temperature to induce protein precipitation, and then, data-independent acquisition was employed for quick protein quantification. Compared with previous thermal shift assays, the analysis throughput of mTSA was significantly improved, but the costs as well as efforts were reduced. More importantly, the matrix experiment design allowed simultaneous computation of the statistical significance and fitting of the dose--response profiles, which can be combined to enable a more accurate identification of target proteins, as well as reporting binding affinities between the ligand and individual targets. Using a pan-specific kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, we demonstrated a 36\% improvement in screening sensitivity over the traditional thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and a comparable sensitivity with a latest two-dimensional TPP. Finally, mTSA was successfully applied to delineate the target landscape of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a persistent organic pollutant that is hard to perform modification on, and revealed several potential targets that might account for the toxicities of PFOS.}

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

  abstract = {The amount of genomic region data continues to increase. Integrating across diverse genomic region sets requires consensus regions, which enable comparing regions across experiments, but also by necessity lose precision in region definitions. We require methods to assess this loss of precision and build optimal consensus region sets. Here, we introduce the concept of flexible intervals and propose three novel methods for building consensus region sets, or universes: a coverage cutoff method, a likelihood method, and a Hidden Markov Model. We then propose three novel measures for evaluating how well a proposed universe fits a collection of region sets: a base-level overlap score, a region boundary distance score, and a likelihood score. We apply our methods and evaluation approaches to several collections of region sets and show how these methods can be used to evaluate fit of universes and build optimal universes. We describe scenarios where the common approach of merging regions to create consensus leads to undesirable outcomes and provide principled alternatives that provide interoperability of interval data while minimizing loss of resolution.}

Akin to the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) used in PubMed, the DATS model enables submission of metadata on datasets to DataMed. DATS has a core set of elements, which are generic and applicable to any type of dataset, and an extended set that can accommodate more specialized data types. DATS is a platform-independent model also available as an annotated serialization in schema.org, which in turn is widely used by major search engines like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.},

  abstract = {Music streaming platforms rely heavily on learning meaningful representations of tracks to surface apt recommendations to users in a number of different use cases. In this work, we consider the task of learning music track representations by leveraging three rich heterogeneous sources of information: (i) organizational information (e.g., playlist co-occurrence), (ii) content information (e.g., audio \& acoustics), and (iii) music stylistics (e.g., genre). We advocate for a multi-task formulation of graph representation learning, and propose MUSIG: Multi-task Sampling and Inductive learning on Graphs. MUSIG allows us to derive generalized track representations that combine the benefits offered by (i) the inductive graph based framework, which generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood, as well as, (ii) multi-task training of aggregation functions, which ensures the learnt functions perform well on a number of important tasks. We present large scale empirical results for track recommendation for the playlist completion task, and compare different classes of representation learning approaches, including collaborative filtering, word2vec and node embeddings as well as, graph embedding approaches. Our results demonstrate that considering content information (i.e.,audio and acoustic features) is useful and that multi-task supervision helps learn better representations.}

However, the vast combinatorial space of possible sequences and the complex regulatory grammars governing gene regulation have proven challenging for existing approaches. Supervised deep learning models that score sequences proposed by local search algorithms ignore the global structure of functional sequence space. While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in learning these distributions, their application to regulatory DNA has been limited. Evaluating the quality of generated sequences also remains challenging due to a lack of a unified framework that characterizes key properties of regulatory DNA. Here we introduce DNA Discrete Diffusion (D3), a generative framework for conditionally sampling regulatory sequences with targeted functional activity levels. We develop a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics that assess the functional similarity, sequence similarity, and regulatory composition of generated sequences. Through benchmarking on three high-quality functional genomics datasets spanning human promoters and fly enhancers, we demonstrate that D3 outperforms existing methods in capturing the diversity of cis-regulatory grammars and generating sequences that more accurately reflect the properties of genomic regulatory DNA. Furthermore, we show that D3-generated sequences can effectively augment supervised models and improve their predictive performance, even in data-limited scenarios.},

Here we introduce CellWhisperer, a multimodal machine learning model and software that connects transcriptomes and text for interactive single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. CellWhisperer enables the chat-based interrogation of transcriptome data in English language. To train our model, we created an AI-curated dataset with over a million pairs of RNA-seq profiles and matched textual annotations across a broad range of human biology, and we established a multimodal embedding of matched transcriptomes and text using contrastive learning. Our model enables free-text search and annotation of transcriptome datasets by cell types, states, and other properties in a zero-shot manner and without the need for reference datasets. Moreover, Cell-Whisperer answers questions about cells and genes in natural-language chats, using a biologically fluent large language model that we fine-tuned to analyze bulk and single-cell transcriptome data across various biological applications. We integrated CellWhisperer with the widely used CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to in-teractively explore RNA-seq data through an integrated graphical and chat interface. Our method demonstrates a new way of working with transcriptome data, leveraging the power of natural language for single-cell data analysis and establishing an important building block for future AI-based bioinformatics research assistants.},

Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)---a blind assessment of the state of the field---AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.},

The accompanying metadata describing the experiments suffer from redundancy, inconsistency and incompleteness due to the prevalence of free text and the lack of well-defined data formats and their validation. To remedy this situation, we created Genomic Metadata Integration (GeMI; http://gmql.eu/gemi/), a web application that learns to automatically extract structured metadata (in the form of key-value pairs) from the plain text descriptions of GEO experiments. The extracted information can then be indexed for structured search and used for various downstream data mining activities. GeMI works in continuous interaction with its users. The natural language processing transformer-based model at the core of our system is a fine-tuned version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT2) model that is able to learn continuously from the feedback of the users thanks to an active learning framework designed for the purpose. As a part of such a framework, a machine learning interpretation mechanism (that exploits saliency maps) allows the users to understand easily and quickly whether the predictions of the model are correct and improves the overall usability. GeMI's ability to extract attributes not explicitly mentioned (such as sex, tissue type, cell type, ethnicity and disease) allows researchers to perform specific queries and classification of experiments, which was previously possible only after spending time and resources with tedious manual annotation. The usefulness of GeMI is demonstrated on practical research use cases.Database URLhttp://gmql.eu/gemi/}

  abstract = {Organizing and annotating biological sample data is critical in data-intensive bioinformatics. Unfortunately, metadata formats from a data provider are often incompatible with requirements of a processing tool. There is no broadly accepted standard to organize metadata across biological projects and bioinformatics tools, restricting the portability and reusability of both annotated datasets and analysis software.To address this, we present the Portable Encapsulated Project (PEP) specification, a formal specification for biological sample metadata structure. The PEP specification accommodates typical features of data-intensive bioinformatics projects with many biological samples. In addition to standardization, the PEP specification provides descriptors and modifiers for project-level and sample-level metadata, which improve portability across both computing environments and data processing tools.

  abstract = {Organizing and annotating biological sample data is critical in data-intensive bioinformatics. Unfortunately, metadata formats from a data provider are often incompatible with requirements of a processing tool. There is no broadly accepted standard to organize metadata across biological projects and bioinformatics tools, restricting the portability and reusability of both annotated datasets and analysis software. To address this, we present Portable Encapsulated Projects (PEP), a formal specification for biological sample metadata structure. The PEP specification accommodates typical features of data-intensive bioinformatics projects with many samples, whether from individual experiments, organisms, or single cells. In addition to standardization, the PEP specification provides descriptors and modifiers for different organizational layers of a project, which improve portability among computing environments and facilitate use of different processing tools. PEP includes a schema validator framework, allowing formal definition of required metadata attributes for any type of biomedical data analysis. We have implemented packages for reading PEPs in both Python and R to provide a language-agnostic interface for organizing project metadata. PEP therefore presents an important step toward unifying data annotation and processing tools in data-intensive biological research projects.},

Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing challenges with big data and ensuring reproducibility in biology. However, despite their advantages, cloud platforms in and of themselves do not automatically support FAIRness. The global push to develop biomedical cloud platforms has led to new challenges, including platform lock-in, difficulty integrating across platforms, and duplicated effort for both users and developers. Here, we argue that these difficulties are systemic and emerge from incentives that encourage development effort on self-sufficient platforms and data repositories instead of interoperable microservices. We argue that many of these issues would be alleviated by prioritizing microservices and access to modular data in smaller chunks or summarized form. We propose that emphasizing modularity and interoperability would lead to a more powerful Unix-like ecosystem of web services for biomedical analysis and data retrieval. We challenge funders, developers, and researchers to support a vision to improve interoperability through microservices as the next generation of cloud-based bioinformatics.},

Current tools to analyse chromatin looping mechanisms using HiChIP data require the identification of loop anchors to work properly. However, current approaches to discover these anchors from HiChIP data are not satisfactory, having either a very high false discovery rate or strong dependence on sequencing depth. Moreover, these tools do not allow quantitative comparison of peaks across different samples, failing to fully exploit the information available from HiChIP datasets.We develop a new tool based on a representation of HiChIP data centred on the re-ligation sites to identify peaks from HiChIP datasets, which can subsequently be used in other tools for loop discovery. This increases the reliability of these tools and improves recall rate as sequencing depth is reduced. We also provide a method to count reads mapping to peaks across samples, which can be used for differential peak analysis using HiChIP data.HiChIP-Peaks is freely available at https://github.com/ChenfuShi/HiChIP\_peaks.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

We present Immunoglobulin Language Model (IgLM), a deep generative language model for generating synthetic libraries by re-designing variable-length spans of antibody sequences. IgLM formulates anti-body design as an autoregressive sequence generation task based on text-infilling in natural language. We trained IgLM on approximately 558M antibody heavy- and light-chain variable sequences, conditioning on each sequence's chain type and species-of-origin.

Although several kinase inhibitors are on the market, inhibitor selectivity and drug resistance mutations persist as fundamental challenges in the development of effective long-term treatments. Chemical entities binding to less conserved allosteric sites would be expected to offer new opportunities for scaffold development. Because no high-throughput method was previously available, we developed a fluorescence-based kinase binding assay for identifying and characterizing ligands which stabilize the inactive kinase conformation. Here, we present a description of the development and validation of this assay using the serine/threonine kinase p38{$\alpha$}. By covalently attaching fluorophores to the activation loop of the kinase, we were able to detect conformational changes and measure the Kd, kon, and koff associated with the binding and dissociation of ligands to the allosteric pocket. We report the SAR of a synthesized focused library of pyrazolourea derivatives, a scaffold known to bind with high affinity to the allosteric pocket of p38{$\alpha$}. Additionally, we used protein X-ray crystallography together with our assay to examine the binding and dissociation kinetics to characterize potent quinazoline- and quinoline-based type II inhibitors, which also utilize this binding pocket in p38{$\alpha$}. Last, we identified the b-Raf inhibitor sorafenib as a potent low nanomolar inhibitor of p38{$\alpha$} and used protein X-ray crystallography to confirm a unique binding mode to the inactive kinase conformation.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of high-throughput sequencing and analysis has accelerated multi-omics studies of thousands of microbial species, metagenomes, and infectious disease pathogens. Omics studies are enabling genotype-phenotype association studies which identify genetic determinants of pathogen virulence and drug resistance, as well as phylogenetic studies designed to track the origin and spread of disease outbreaks. These omics studies are complex and often employ multiple assay technologies including genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. To maximize the impact of omics studies, it is essential that data be accompanied by detailed contextual metadata (e.g., specimen, spatial-temporal, phenotypic characteristics) in clear, organized, and consistent formats. Over the years, many metadata standards developed by various metadata standards initiatives have arisen; the Genomic Standards Consortium's minimal information standards (MIxS), the GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard. Some tools exist for tracking metadata, but they do not provide event based capabilities to configure, collect, validate, and distribute metadata. To address this gap in the scientific community, an event based data-driven application, OMeta, was created that allows users to quickly configure, collect, validate, distribute, and integrate metadata. RESULTS: A data-driven web application, OMeta, has been developed for use by researchers consisting of a browser-based interface, a command-line interface (CLI), and server-side components that provide an intuitive platform for configuring, capturing, viewing, and sharing metadata. Project and sample metadata can be set based on existing standards or based on projects goals. Recorded information includes details on the biological samples, procedures, protocols, and experimental technologies, etc. This information can be organized based on events, including sample collection, sample quantification, sequencing assay, and analysis results. OMeta enables configuration in various presentation types: checkbox, file, drop-box, ontology, and fields can be configured to use the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), a biomedical ontology server. Furthermore, OMeta maintains a complete audit trail of all changes made by users and allows metadata export in comma separated value (CSV) format for convenient deposition of data into public databases. CONCLUSIONS: We present, OMeta, a web-based software application that is built on data-driven principles for configuring and customizing data standards, capturing, curating, and sharing metadata.},

Raster data refers to satellite imagery while vector data includes GPS data, Tweets, and regional boundaries. While there are many real-world applications that need to process both raster and vector data concurrently, state-of-the-art systems are limited to processing one of these two representations while converting the other one which limits their scalability. This paper draws the attention of the research community to the research problems that emerge from the concurrent processing of raster and vector data. It describes three real-world applications and explains their computation and access patterns for raster and vector data. Additionally, it runs an extensive experimental evaluation using state-of-the-art big spatial data systems with raster data of up-to a trillion pixels, and vector data with up-to hundreds of millions of edges. The results show that while most systems can analyze raster and vector concurrently, but they have limited scalability for large-scale data.},

Range-join is widely used in various genome analysis processes such as annotation, filtering and comparison of variants in whole-genome and exome analysis pipelines. The quadratic complexity of current algorithms with sheer data volume has surged the design challenges. Existing tools have limitations on algorithm efficiency, parallelism, scalability and memory consumption. This paper proposes BIndex, a novel bin-based indexing algorithm and its distributed implementation to attain high throughput range-join processing. BIndex features near-constant search complexity while the inherently parallel data structure facilitates exploitation of parallel computing architectures. Balanced partitioning of dataset further enables scalability on distributed frameworks. The implementation on Message Passing Interface shows upto 933.5x speedup in comparison to state-of-the-art tools. Parallel nature of BIndex further enables GPU-based acceleration with 3.72x speedup than CPU implementations. The add-in modules for Apache Spark provides upto 4.65x speedup than the previously best available tool. BIndex supports wide variety of input and output formats prevalent in bioinformatics community and the algorithm is easily extendable to streaming data in recent Big Data solutions. Furthermore, the index data structure is memory-efficient and consumes upto two orders-of-magnitude lesser RAM, while having no adverse effect on speedup.},

These data are available for searching, visualization and download at the new ENCODE Portal (www.encodeproject.org). The revamped ENCODE Portal provides new ways to browse and search the ENCODE data based on the metadata that describe the assays as well as summaries of the assays that focus on data provenance. In addition, it is a flexible platform that allows integration of genomic data from multiple projects. The portal experience was designed to improve access to ENCODE data by relying on metadata that allow reusability and reproducibility of the experiments.}

Because the ATAC-seq protocol is both simple and relatively inexpensive, there has been a rapid increase in the availability of chromatin accessibility data. Furthermore, advances in ATAC-seq protocols are rapidly extending its breadth to additional experimental conditions, cell types, and species. Accompanying the increase in data, there has also been an explosion of new tools and analytical approaches for analyzing it. Here, we explain the fundamentals of ATAC-seq data processing, summarize common analysis approaches, and review computational tools to provide recommendations for different research questions.

  abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays fundamental roles in cellular biochemistry and was recently discovered to function as a biological hydrotrope. Here, we use mass spectrometry to interrogate ATP-mediated regulation of protein thermal stability and protein solubility on a proteome-wide scale. Thermal proteome profiling reveals high affinity interactions of ATP as a substrate and as an allosteric modulator that has widespread influence on protein complexes and their stability. Further, we develop a strategy for proteome-wide solubility profiling, and discover ATP-dependent solubilization of at least 25\% of the insoluble proteome. ATP increases the solubility of positively charged, intrinsically disordered proteins, and their susceptibility for solubilization varies depending on their localization to different membrane-less organelles. Moreover, a few proteins, exhibit an ATP-dependent decrease in solubility, likely reflecting polymer formation. Our data provides a proteome-wide, quantitative insight into how ATP influences protein structure and solubility across the spectrum of physiologically relevant concentrations.},

  abstract = {Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear-programming-based inductive classifier, have been used to create a highly accurate system for diagnosis of breast tumors. A small fraction of a fine needle aspirate slide is selected and digitized. With an interactive interface, the user initializes active contour models, known as snakes, near the boundaries of a set of cell nuclei. The customized snakes are deformed to the exact shape of the nuclei. This allows for precise, automated analysis of nuclear size, shape and texture. Ten such features are computed for each nucleus, and the mean value, largest (or 'worst') value and standard error of each feature are found over the range of isolated cells. After 569 images were analyzed in this fashion, different combinations of features were tested to find those which best separate benign from malignant samples. Ten-fold cross-validation accuracy of 97\% was achieved using a single separating plane on three of the thirty features: mean texture, worst area and worst smoothness. This represents an improvement over the best diagnostic results in the medical literature. The system is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The same feature set has also been utilized in the much more difficult task of predicting distant recurrence of malignancy in patients, resulting in an accuracy of 86\%.}

  abstract = {ObjectivesTo explain apparent differences among mammography screening services in Sweden using individual data on participation in screening and with breast cancer?specific survival as an outcome.MethodsWe analysed breast cancer survival data from the Swedish Cancer Register on breast cancer cases from nine Swedish counties diagnosed in women eligible for screening. Data were available on 38,278 breast cancers diagnosed and 4312 breast cancer deaths. Survival to death from breast cancer was estimated using the Kaplan?Meier estimate, for all cases in each county, and separately for cases of women participating and not participating in their last invitation to screening. Formal statistical comparisons of survival were made using proportional hazards regression.ResultsAll counties showed a reduction in the hazard of breast cancer death with participation in screening, but the reductions for individual counties varied substantially, ranging from 51\% (95\% confidence interval 46?55\%) to 81\% (95\% confidence interval 74?85\%). Survival rates in nonparticipating women ranged from 53\% (95\% confidence interval 40?65\%) to 74\% (95\% confidence interval 72?77\%), while the corresponding survival in women participating in screening varied from 80\% (95\% confidence interval 77?84\%) to 86\% (95\% confidence interval 83?88\%), a considerably narrower range.ConclusionsDifferences among counties in the effect of screening on breast cancer outcomes were mainly due to variation in survival in women not participating in screening. Screening conferred similarly high survival rates in all counties. This indicates that the performance of screening services was similar across counties and that detection and treatment of breast cancer in early-stage reduces inequalities in breast cancer outcome.},

A model has been constructed that integrates all quantitative data and includes structural models of abundant proteins. Synaptic vesicles are dominated by proteins, possess a surprising diversity of trafficking proteins, and, with the exception of the V-ATPase that is present in only one to two copies, contain numerous copies of proteins essential for membrane traffic and neurotransmitter uptake.},

When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. RESULTS: We describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75\% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or approximately 54\% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the KOGs; addition of new eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with KOGs. Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of approximately 20\% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set (approximately 1\% of the COGs). In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. CONCLUSION: The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

To enable interpretable NLP models, we create vectors where each dimension is inherently interpretable. By inherently interpretable, we mean a system where each dimension is associated with some human understandable hint that can describe the meaning of that dimension. In order to create more interpretable word embeddings, we transform pretrained dense word embeddings into sparse embeddings. These new embeddings are inherently interpretable: each of their dimensions is created from and represents a natural language word or specific grammatical concept. We construct these embeddings through sparse coding, where each vector in the basis set is itself a word embedding. Therefore, each dimension of our sparse vectors corresponds to a natural language word. We also show that models trained using these sparse embeddings can achieve good performance and are more interpretable in practice, including through human evaluations.},

Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30\,million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

AMULET (ATAC-seq MULtiplet Estimation Tool) enumerates regions with greater than two uniquely aligned reads across the genome to effectively detect multiplets. We evaluate the method by generating snATAC-seq data in the human blood and pancreatic islet samples. AMULET has high precision, estimated via donor-based multiplexing, and high recall, estimated via simulated multiplets, compared to alternatives and identifies multiplets most effectively when a certain read depth of 25K median valid reads per nucleus is achieved.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify {$\sim$}2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect {$\sim$}580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase\,I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

Text style transfer is defined as a task of adapting and/or changing the stylistic manner in which a sentence is written, while preserving the meaning of the original sentence. A systematic review of text style transfer methodologies using deep learning is presented in this paper. We point out the technological advances in deep neural networks that have been the driving force behind current successes in the fields of natural language understanding and generation. The review is structured around two key stages in the text style transfer process, namely, representation learning and sentence generation in a new style. The discussion highlights the commonalities and differences between proposed solutions as well as challenges and opportunities that are expected to direct and foster further research in the field.},

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

We provide an in-depth review of recent advances in representation learning with a focus on autoencoder-based models. To organize these results we make use of meta-priors believed useful for downstream tasks, such as disentanglement and hierarchical organization of features. In particular, we uncover three main mechanisms to enforce such properties, namely (i) regularizing the (approximate or aggregate) posterior distribution, (ii) factorizing the encoding and decoding distribution, or (iii) introducing a structured prior distribution. While there are some promising results, implicit or explicit supervision remains a key enabler and all current methods use strong inductive biases and modeling assumptions. Finally, we provide an analysis of autoencoder-based representation learning through the lens of rate-distortion theory and identify a clear tradeoff between the amount of prior knowledge available about the downstream tasks, and how useful the representation is for this task.},

  abstract = {Multi-modal learning is essential for understanding information in the real world. Jointly learning from multi-modal data enables global integration of both shared and modality-specific information, but current strategies often fail when observa- tions from certain modalities are incomplete or missing for part of the subjects. To learn comprehensive representations based on such modality-incomplete data, we present a semi-supervised neural network model called CLUE (Cross-Linked Unified Embedding). Extending from multi-modal VAEs, CLUE introduces the use of cross-encoders to construct latent representations from modality-incomplete observations. Representation learning for modality-incomplete observations is common in genomics. For example, human cells are tightly regulated across multi- ple related but distinct modalities such as DNA, RNA, and protein, jointly defining a cell's function. We benchmark CLUE on multi-modal data from single cell measurements, illustrating CLUE's superior performance in all assessed categories of the NeurIPS 2021 Multimodal Single-cell Data Integration Competition. While we focus on analysis of single cell genomic datasets, we note that the proposed cross-linked embedding strategy could be readily applied to other cross-modality representation learning problems.},

  abstract = {To establish the druggability of a target, genetic validation needs to be supplemented with pharmacological validation. Pharmacological studies, especially in the kinase field, are hampered by the fact that many reference inhibitors are not fully selective for one target. Fortunately, the initial trickle of selective inhibitors released in the public domain has steadily swelled into a stream. However, rationally picking the most selective tool compound out of the increasing amounts of available inhibitors has become progressively difficult due to the lack of accurate quantitative descriptors of drug selectivity. A recently published approach, termed `selectivity entropy', is an improved way of expressing selectivity as a single-value parameter and enables rank ordering of inhibitors. We provide a guide to select the best tool compounds for pharmacological validation experiments of candidate drug targets using selectivity entropy. In addition, we recommend which inhibitors to use for studying the biology of the 20 most investigated kinases that are clinically relevant: Abl (ABL1), AKT1, ALK, Aurora A/B, CDKs, MET, CSF1R (FMS), EGFR, FLT3, ERBB2 (HER2), IKBKB (IKK2), JAK2/3, JNK1/2/3 (MAPK8/9/10), MEK1/2, PLK1, PI3Ks, p38{$\alpha$} (MAPK14), BRAF, SRC and VEGFR2 (KDR).},

We validate MAGIC on several biological systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover regulatory relations without perturbations.},

PTK inhibitor screening data are, however, poorly comparable because of the different assay technologies used. Here we report a comparison of ELISA-based assays for screening epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitory compound libraries to study interassay variations. All assays were based on the same protocol, except for the source of EGFR-TK enzymes. In the first protocol, the enzyme was isolated from A431 cells without affinity purification. In the second protocol, commercial EGFR-TK (Sigma) isolated from A431 cells by affinity-purification was employed. In the third protocol, an enzyme preparation obtained from a recombinant (Baculovirus transfected Sf9 cells) expression system was used. All assays employed the synthetic peptide substrate poly-(Glu, Tyr)1:4 and an ELISA-based system to detect phosphorylated tyrosine residues by a monoclonal antibody. We observed significant differences in both the activity of the enzymes and in the EGFR-TK inhibitory effect of our reference compound PD153035. The differences were significant in case of A431 cell lysate compared to affinity purified EGFR-TKs derived from either A431cells or Baculovirus transfected Sf9 cells, whereas the latter two showed comparable results. Our data suggest that differences in terms of interassay variation are not related to the source of the enzyme but to its purity; changes in the mode of detection can markedly influence the reproducibility of results. In conclusion, normalization of the EGFR activity used for inhibitor screening and standardization of detection methods enable safe comparison of data.},

We first validate AbBERT using a novel ``multi-mask'' scoring procedure to demonstrate high accuracy in predicting complementary determining regions---including the challenging hypervariable H3 region. We then demonstrate several uses of AbBERT at various points along the antibody design process. AbBERT enhances in silico antibody optimization via deep reinforcement learning by utilizing its learned embeddings as additional observations during optimization. Within a larger computational antibody design platform, AbBERT has been successfully applied as an additional design objective, where it displays strong correlations with computational tools predicting antibody structural stability. Finally, mutant antibody sequences that have been scored as unfavorable by AbBERT have shown corresponding low yields when expressed in cells. These use cases demonstrate the power of language modeling within computational antibody design.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

In this paper, we discuss the necessity of correction for chance for information theoretic based measures for clusterings comparison. We observe that the baseline for such measures, i.e. average value between random partitions of a data set, does not take on a constant value, and tends to have larger variation when the ratio between the number of data points and the number of clusters is small. This effect is similar in some other non-information theoretic based measures such as the well-known Rand Index. Assuming a hypergeometric model of randomness, we derive the analytical formula for the expected mutual information value between a pair of clusterings, and then propose the adjusted version for several popular information theoretic based measures. Some examples are given to demonstrate the need and usefulness of the adjusted measures.},

  abstract = {Mutations of the cohesin complex in human cancer were first discovered {\textasciitilde}10 years ago. Since then, researchers worldwide have demonstrated that cohesin is among the most commonly mutated protein complexes in cancer. Inactivating mutations in genes encoding cohesin subunits are common in bladder cancers, paediatric sarcomas, leukaemias, brain tumours and other cancer types. Also in those 10 years, the prevailing view of the functions of cohesin in cell biology has undergone a revolutionary transformation. Initially, the predominant view of cohesin was as a ring that encircled and cohered replicated chromosomes until its cleavage triggered the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. As such, early studies focused on the role of tumour-derived cohesin mutations in the fidelity of chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. However, over the past 5 years the cohesin field has shifted dramatically, and research now focuses on the primary role of cohesin in generating, maintaining and regulating the intra-chromosomal DNA looping events that modulate 3D genome organization and gene expression. This Review focuses on recent discoveries in the cohesin field that provide insight into the role of cohesin inactivation in cancer pathogenesis, and opportunities for exploiting these findings for the clinical benefit of patients with cohesin-mutant cancers.},

Genomic biomarker testing may detect molecular variations in single genes, panels of genes, or entire genomes. The strength of evidence for the association of a genomic biomarker with disease risk may be weak or strong. The factors contributing to clinical validity and utility of genomic biomarkers include functional laboratory analyses and genetic epidemiologic evidence. Genomic biomarkers may be further classified as low, moderate or highly penetrant based on the likelihood of disease. Genomic biomarkers for breast cancer are comprised of rare highly penetrant mutations of genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, moderately penetrant mutations of genes such as CHEK2, as well as more common genomic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, associated with modest effect sizes. When applied in the context of appropriate counseling and interpretation, identification of genomic biomarkers of inherited risk for breast cancer may decrease morbidity and mortality, allow for definitive prevention through assisted reproduction, and serve as a guide to targeted therapyTherapy.},

However, it lacks the capacity of utilizing instance-level information from individual instances in the training set. In this work, we propose to enhance neural network models by allowing them to leverage information from \$k\$-nearest neighbor (kNN) of the input text. Our model employs a neural network that encodes texts into text embeddings. Moreover, we also utilize \$k\$-nearest neighbor of the input text as an external memory, and utilize it to capture instance-level information from the training set. The final prediction is made based on features from both the neural network encoder and the kNN memory. Experimental results on several standard benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline model on all the datasets, and it even beats a very deep neural network model (with 29 layers) in several datasets. Our model also shows superior performance when training instances are scarce, and when the training set is severely unbalanced. Our model also leverages techniques such as semi-supervised training and transfer learning quite well.},

Human ATAC-seq datasets are accumulating rapidly, prompting an urgent need to comprehensively collect and effectively process these data. We developed a comprehensive human chromatin accessibility database (ATACdb, http://www.licpathway.net/ATACdb), with the aim of providing a large amount of publicly available resources on human chromatin accessibility data, and to annotate and illustrate potential roles in a tissue/cell type-specific manner. The current version of ATACdb documented a total of 52~078~883 regions from over 1400 ATAC-seq samples. These samples have been manually curated from over 2200 chromatin accessibility samples from NCBI GEO/SRA. To make these datasets more accessible to the research community, ATACdb provides a quality assurance process including four quality control (QC) metrics. ATACdb provides detailed (epi)genetic annotations in chromatin accessibility regions, including super-enhancers, typical enhancers, transcription factors (TFs), common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), risk SNPs, eQTLs, LD SNPs, methylations, chromatin interactions and TADs. Especially, ATACdb provides accurate inference of TF footprints within chromatin accessibility regions. ATACdb is a powerful platform that provides the most comprehensive accessible chromatin data, QC, TF footprint and various other annotations.}

At the same time, cell type annotation is critical in understanding the cellular composition of complex tissues and identifying potential novel cell types. However, most existing methods that can perform automated cell type annotation are designed to transfer labels from an annotated scRNA-seq data set to another scRNA-seq data set, and it is not clear whether these methods are adaptable to annotate scATAC-seq data. Several methods have been recently proposed for label transfer from scRNA-seq data to scATAC-seq data, but there is a lack of benchmarking study on the performance of these methods. Here, we evaluated the performance of five scATAC-seq annotation methods on both their classification accuracy and scalability using publicly available single-cell datasets from mouse and human tissues including brain, lung, kidney, PBMC, and BMMC. Using the BMMC data as basis, we further investigated the performance of these methods across different data sizes, mislabeling rates, sequencing depths and the number of cell types unique to scATAC-seq. Bridge integration, which is the only method that requires additional multimodal data and does not need gene activity calculation, was overall the best method and robust to changes in data size, mislabeling rate and sequencing depth. Conos was the most time and memory efficient method but performed the worst in terms of prediction accuracy. scJoint tended to assign cells to similar cell types and performed relatively poorly for complex datasets with deep annotations but performed better for datasets only with major label annotations. The performance of scGCN and Seurat v3 was moderate, but scGCN was the most time-consuming method and had the most similar performance to random classifiers for cell types unique to scATAC-seq.}

However, integrating single-cell omics datasets presents unique challenges due to varied feature correlations and technology-specific limitations. To address these challenges, we introduce scMODAL, a deep learning framework tailored for single-cell multi-omics data alignment using feature links. scMODAL integrates datasets with limited known positively correlated features, leveraging neural networks and generative adversarial networks to align cell embeddings and preserve feature topology. Our experiments demonstrate scMODAL's effectiveness in removing unwanted variation, preserving biological information, and accurately identifying cell subpopulations across diverse datasets. scMODAL not only advances integration tasks but also supports downstream analyses such as feature imputation and feature relationship inference, offering a robust solution for advancing single-cell multi-omics research.},

  abstract = {Dropout is a widely-used regularization technique, often required to obtain state-of-the-art for a number of architectures. This work demonstrates that dropout introduces two distinct but entangled regularization effects: an explicit effect (also studied in prior work) which occurs since dropout modifies the expected training objective, and, perhaps surprisingly, an additional implicit effect from the stochasticity in the dropout training update. This implicit regularization effect is analogous to the effect of stochasticity in small mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. We disentangle these two effects through controlled experiments. We then derive analytic simplifications which characterize each effect in terms of the derivatives of the model and the loss, for deep neural networks. We demonstrate these simplified, analytic regularizers accurately capture the important aspects of dropout, showing they faithfully replace dropout in practice.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous tissue repair aims at restoring the barrier function of the skin. To achieve this, defects need to be replaced by granulation tissue to form new connective tissue, and epithelial wound closure is required to restore the physical barrier. Different wound-healing phases are recognized, starting with an inflammation-dominated early phase giving way to granulation tissue build-up and scar remodeling after epithelial wound closure has been achieved. In the granulation tissue, mesenchymal cells are maximally activated, cells proliferate, and synthesize huge amounts of extracellular matrix. Epithelial cells also proliferate and migrate over the provisional matrix of the underlying granulation tissue, eventually closing the defect. This review focuses on the role of keratinocyte--fibroblast interactions in the wound-healing process. There is ample evidence that keratinocytes stimulate fibroblasts to synthesize growth factors, which in turn will stimulate keratinocyte proliferation in a double paracrine manner. Moreover, fibroblasts can acquire a myofibroblast phenotype under the control of keratinocytes. This depends on a finely tuned balance between a proinflammatory or a transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}-dominated environment. As the phenotype of fibroblasts from different tissues or body sites becomes better defined, we may understand their individual contribution in wound healing in more detail and possibly explain different clinical outcomes.},

An obstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural configuration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically vary across data types (i.e., 10x larger over images than over language). We theoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits the contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We thus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal depth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added advantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this bottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer architectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often glossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in different domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework allows us to identify size redundancies of 25\%-50\% in leading NLP models such as ALBERT and T5.},

  abstract = {As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we leverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence.},

The stem cell factor--dependent multipotent progenitor cell line HPC-7 represents a well-recognized cell line model for HSPCs. Here we report genome-wide maps for 17 TFs, 3 histone modifications, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and high-resolution promoter-enhancer interactomes in HPC-7 cells. Integrated analysis of these complementary data sets revealed TF occupancy patterns of genomic regions involved in promoter-anchored loops. Moreover, preferential associations between pairs of TFs bound at either ends of chromatin loops led to the identification of 4 previously unrecognized protein-protein interactions between key blood stem cell regulators. All HPC-7 data sets are freely available both through standard repositories and a user-friendly Web interface. Together with previously generated genome-wide data sets, this study integrates HPC-7 data into a genomic resource on par with ENCODE tier 1 cell lines and, importantly, is the only current model with comprehensive genome-scale data that is relevant to HSPC biology.},

Additionally, macrophages were first polarized to M1 and then to M2 (M1{$\rightarrow$}M2) to generate a phenotype typically observed during normal wound healing. Human dermal fibroblasts that were cultured in macrophage-conditioned media upregulated numerous genes involved in regulation of ECM assembly, especially in M2-conditioned media. Hybrid M1/M2 macrophageconditioned media caused fibroblasts to produce a matrix with thicker and less aligned fibers, while M2 macrophage-conditioned media caused the formation of a more aligned matrix with thinner fibers. Gelatin methacrylate hydrogels containing interleukin-4 (IL4) and IL13-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles were designed to promote the M2 phenotype in a murine subcutaneous in vivo model. NanoString multiplex gene expression analysis of hydrogel explants showed that hydrogels without cytokines caused mostly M1 phenotype markers to be highly expressed at an early time point (3 days), but the release of IL4+IL13 promoted upregulation of M2 markers and genes associated with regulation of ECM assembly, such as Col5a1 and Col6a1. Biochemical analysis and second harmonic generation microscopy showed that the release of IL4+IL13 increased total sulfated glycosaminoglycan content and decreased fibril alignment, which is typically associated with less fibrotic tissue. Together, these results show that hybrid M1/M2 macrophages regulate ECM assembly, and that shifting the balance towards M2 may promote architectural and compositional changes in ECM with enhanced potential for downstream remodeling.},

  abstract = {We recently introduced the Gini coefficient (GC) for assessing the expression variation of a particular gene in a dataset, as a means of selecting improved reference genes over the cohort (`housekeeping genes') typically used for normalisation in expression profiling studies. Those genes (transcripts) that we determined to be useable as reference genes differed greatly from previous suggestions based on hypothesis-driven approaches. A limitation of this initial study is that a single (albeit large) dataset was employed for both tissues and cell lines. We here extend this analysis to encompass seven other large datasets. Although their absolute values differ a little, the Gini values and median expression levels of the various genes are well correlated with each other between the various cell line datasets, implying that our original choice of the more ubiquitously expressed low-Gini-coefficient genes was indeed sound. In tissues, the Gini values and median expression levels of genes showed a greater variation, with the GC of genes changing with the number and types of tissues in the data sets. In all data sets, regardless of whether this was derived from tissues or cell lines, we also show that the GC is a robust measure of gene expression stability. Using the GC as a measure of expression stability we illustrate its utility to find tissue- and cell line-optimised housekeeping genes without any prior bias, that again include only a small number of previously reported housekeeping genes. We also independently confirmed this experimentally using RT-qPCR with 40 candidate GC genes in a panel of 10 cell lines. These were termed the Gini Genes. In many cases, the variation in the expression levels of classical reference genes is really quite huge (e.g. 44 fold for GAPDH in one data set), suggesting that the cure (of using them as normalising genes) may in some cases be worse than the disease (of not doing so). We recommend the present data-driven approach for the selection of reference genes by using the easy-to-calculate and robust GC.},

  abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units ("wordpieces") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of "character"-delimited models and the efficiency of "word"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60\% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous profiling of multiomic modalities within a single cell is a grand challenge for single-cell biology. While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility---for example, generating paired measurements of single-cell transcriptome (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) and chromatin accessibility (single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [scATAC-seq])---widespread application of joint profiling is challenging due to its experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here, we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging an interoperable neural network model, BABEL can predict single-cell expression directly from a cell's scATAC-seq and vice versa after training on relevant data. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multiomic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired single-cell ATAC and gene expression datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to cell types within new biological contexts not seen during training. Starting from scATAC-seq of patient-derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated single-cell expression that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of experimental BCC scRNA-seq data for diverse cell types related to BABEL's training data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as protein epitope profiling, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows for an interpretation of gene expression through pre-defined gene set databases and is a critical step in understanding different phenotypes. With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, GSE analysis can be performed on fine-grained gene expression data to gain a nuanced understanding of phenotypes of interest. However, with the cellular heterogeneity in single-cell gene profiles, current statistical GSE analysis methods sometimes fail to identify enriched gene sets. Meanwhile, deep learning has gained traction in applications like clustering and trajectory inference in single-cell studies due to its prowess in capturing complex data patterns. However, its use in GSE analysis remains limited, due to interpretability challenges.In this paper, we present DeepGSEA, an explainable deep gene set enrichment analysis approach which leverages the expressiveness of interpretable, prototype-based neural networks to provide an in-depth analysis of GSE. DeepGSEA learns the ability to capture GSE information through our designed classification tasks, and significance tests can be performed on each gene set, enabling the identification of enriched sets. The underlying distribution of a gene set learned by DeepGSEA can be explicitly visualized using the encoded cell and cellular prototype embeddings. We demonstrate the performance of DeepGSEA over commonly used GSE analysis methods by examining their sensitivity and specificity with four simulation studies. In addition, we test our model on three real scRNA-seq datasets and illustrate the interpretability of DeepGSEA by showing how its results can be explained.https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/DeepGSEA}

Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer lymph node metastasis still remain elusive. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to acquire the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells from primary tumors, negative lymph nodes (NLs) and positive lymph nodes (PLs). We also performed a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (scATAC-seq) of the positive and NL samples to get the chromatin accessibility profile. We identified a novel cell subpopulation with an abnormally high expression level of CXCL14 in the PL of breast cancer patients. Cell trajectory analysis also revealed that CXCL14 was increased expressed in the late pseudo-time. Moreover, based on a tissue microarray of 55 patients and the Oncomine database, we validated that CXCL14 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, scATAC-seq identified several transcription factors that may be potential regulation factors for the lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. Thus, our findings will improve our current understanding of the mechanism for lymph node metastasis, and they are potentially valuable in providing novel prognosis markers for the lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer.}

The C-terminal domain of hSLK includes both the coiled-coil structure and four Pro/Glu/Ser/Thr-rich (PEST) sequences, but not the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) that is characteristic of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, polyproline consensus binding sites, or the Leu-rich domain seen in the group I germinal center kinases (GCKs). Northern blot analysis indicated that hSLK was ubiquitously expressed. hSLK overexpressed in COS-7 cells phosphorylates itself as well as myelin basic protein used as a substrate. On the other hand, hSLK cannot activate any of the three well-characterized mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK (ERK, JNK/SAPK and p38) pathways. Moreover, hSLK kinase activity is not upregulated by constitutive active forms of GTPases (RasV12, RacV12 and Cdc42V12). These structural and functional properties indicate that hSLK should be considered to be a new member of group II GCKs.},

Our data confirmed association of STAT4 (rs7574865, odds ratio (OR) =1.71, P=3.55 {\texttimes} 10-23) and BLK (rs13277113, OR=0.77, P=1.34 {\texttimes} 10-5) with SLE. It was showed that rs7574865 of STAT4 is also linked to hematologic disorders and potentially some other subphenotypes of the disease. More than one genetic variant in STAT4 were found to be associated with the disease independently in our populations (rs7601754, OR=0.59, P=1.39 {\texttimes} 10-9, and P=0.00034 when controlling the effect of rs7574865). With the same set of samples, however, our study did not detect any significant disease association for PXK, a risk factor for populations of European origin (rs6445975, joint P=0.36, OR=1.06, 95\% confidence interval: 0.93--1.21). Our study indicates that some of the susceptibility genes for this disease may be population specific.},

ML methods use data to predict how sequence maps to function without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways. To demonstrate ML-guided directed evolution, we introduce the steps required to build ML sequence-function models and use them to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to using ML for protein engineering as well as the current literature and applications of this new engineering paradigm. ML methods accelerate directed evolution by learning from information contained in all measured variants and using that information to select sequences that are likely to be improved. We then provide two case studies that demonstrate the ML-guided directed evolution process. We also look to future opportunities where ML will enable discovery of new protein functions and uncover the relationship between protein sequence and function.},

We developed a pretrained deep neural network-based model, single-cell bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (scBERT), to overcome the challenges. Following BERT's approach to pretraining and fine-tuning, scBERT attains a general understanding of gene--gene interactions by being pretrained on huge amounts of unlabelled scRNA-seq data; it is then transferred to the cell type annotation task of unseen and user-specific scRNA-seq data for supervised fine-tuning. Extensive and rigorous benchmark studies validated the superior performance of scBERT on cell type annotation, novel cell type discovery, robustness to batch effects and model interpretability.},

And there are only a few articles studying 0Shot-TC, all focusing only on topical categorization which, we argue, is just the tip of the iceberg in 0Shot-TC. In addition, the chaotic experiments in literature make no uniform comparison, which blurs the progress. This work benchmarks the 0Shot-TC problem by providing unified datasets, standardized evaluations, and state-of-the-art baselines. Our contributions include: i) The datasets we provide facilitate studying 0Shot-TC relative to conceptually different and diverse aspects: the ``topic'' aspect includes ``sports'' and ``politics'' as labels; the ``emotion'' aspect includes ``joy'' and ``anger''; the ``situation'' aspect includes ``medical assistance'' and ``water shortage''. ii) We extend the existing evaluation setup (label-partially-unseen) -- given a dataset, train on some labels, test on all labels -- to include a more challenging yet realistic evaluation label-fully-unseen 0Shot-TC (Chang et al., 2008), aiming at classifying text snippets without seeing task specific training data at all. iii) We unify the 0Shot-TC of diverse aspects within a textual entailment formulation and study it this way.

Ideally, we would like to extend an open-vocabulary detector such that it can produce bounding box predictions based on user inputs in form of either natural language or exemplar image. This offers great flexibility and user experience for human-computer interaction. To this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary detector based on DETR -- hence the name OV-DETR -- which, once trained, can detect any object given its class name or an exemplar image. The biggest challenge of turning DETR into an open-vocabulary detector is that it is impossible to calculate the classification cost matrix of novel classes without access to their labeled images. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the learning objective as a binary matching one between input queries (class name or exemplar image) and the corresponding objects, which learns useful correspondence to generalize to unseen queries during testing. For training, we choose to condition the Transformer decoder on the input embeddings obtained from a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP, in order to enable matching for both text and image queries. With extensive experiments on LVIS and COCO datasets, we demonstrate that our OV-DETR -- the first end-to-end Transformer-based open-vocabulary detector -- achieves non-trivial improvements over current state of the arts.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised methods, such as clustering methods, are essential to the analysis of single-cell genomic data. The most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. The integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. In this paper, we propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. In co-clustering, both the cells and the genomic features are simultaneously clustered. Clustering similar genomic features reduces the noise in single-cell data and facilitates transfer of knowledge across single-cell datasets. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. Our method coupleCoC is also computationally efficient and can scale up to large datasets.Availability: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC.}

As such, IL-17 can mediate protective innate immunity to pathogens or contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. This review summarizes the basic biology of IL-17 and discusses its emerging role in periodontal disease. The current burden of evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the net effect of IL-17 signaling promotes disease development. In addition to promoting neutrophilic inflammation, IL-17 has potent pro-osteoclastogenic effects that are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases involving bone immunopathology. Systemic treatments with anti-IL-17 biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, although their impact on the highly prevalent periodontal disease has not been investigated or reported. Future clinical trials, preferably using locally administered IL-17 blockers, are required to conclusively implicate IL-17 in periodontitis and, more importantly, to establish an effective adjunctive treatment for this oral inflammatory disease.},

We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop, the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited, and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes. The CDK/cyclin-like complex formed by two kinase domains thus explains the activation of EGFR-family receptors by homo- or heterodimerization.},

The user can input any complete or partial functional genomic dataset, for example, a binding intensity file (bigWig) or a peak file. GeNemo reports any genomic regions, ranging from hundred bases to hundred thousand bases, from any of the online ENCODE datasets that share similar functional (binding, modification, accessibility) patterns. This is enabled by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based maximization process, executed on up to 24 parallel computing threads.

However, the global patterns of somatic mutations, especially non-coding mutations, and their roles in defining molecular subtypes of cancer have not been well characterized due to the computational challenges in analysing the complex mutational patterns.Here, we develop a new algorithm, called MutSpace, to effectively extract patient-specific mutational features using an embedding framework for larger sequence context. Our method is motivated by the observation that the mutation rate at megabase scale and the local mutational patterns jointly contribute to distinguishing cancer subtypes, both of which can be simultaneously captured by MutSpace. Simulation evaluations show that MutSpace can effectively characterize mutational features from known patient subgroups and achieve superior performance compared with previous methods. As a proof-of-principle, we apply MutSpace to 560 breast cancer patient samples and demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in subtype identification. In addition, the learned embeddings from MutSpace reflect intrinsic patterns of breast cancer subtypes and other features of genome structure and function. MutSpace is a promising new framework to better understand cancer heterogeneity based on somatic mutations.Source code of MutSpace can be accessed at: https://github.com/ma-compbio/MutSpace.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

Sentence BERT (SBERT) attempted to solve this challenge by learning semantically meaningful representations of single sentences, such that similarity comparison can be easily accessed. However, SBERT is trained on corpus with high-quality labeled sentence pairs, which limits its application to tasks where labeled data is extremely scarce. In this paper, we propose a lightweight extension on top of BERT and a novel self-supervised learning objective based on mutual information maximization strategies to derive meaningful sentence embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Unlike SBERT, our method is not restricted by the availability of labeled data, such that it can be applied on different domain-specific corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other unsupervised sentence embedding baselines on common semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and downstream supervised tasks. It also outperforms SBERT in a setting where in-domain labeled data is not available, and achieves performance competitive with supervised methods on various tasks.},

  abstract = {Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized the study of gene regulation in complex tissues. A major computational challenge in analyzing these datasets is to project the large-scale and high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining the relative relationships between cells. This low dimension embedding is necessary to decompose cellular heterogeneity and reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, face challenges in computational efficiency and in comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, scalability and versatility across diverse single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell analysis.},

  abstract = {The ATP site of kinases displays remarkable conformational flexibility when accommodating chemically diverse small molecule inhibitors. The so-called activation segment, whose conformation controls catalytic activity and access to the substrate binding pocket, can undergo a large conformational change with the active state assuming a `DFG-in' and an inactive state assuming a `DFG-out' conformation. Compounds that preferentially bind to the DFG-out conformation are typically called `type II' inhibitors in contrast to `type I' inhibitors that bind to the DFG-in conformation. This review surveys the large number of type II inhibitors that have been developed and provides an analysis of their crystallographically determined binding modes. Using a small library of type II inhibitors, we demonstrate that more than 200 kinases can be targeted, suggesting that type II inhibitors may not be intrinsically more selective than type I inhibitors.}

No freely available tools provide straightforward approaches for consistent, flexible metadata collection and linkage of related experimental data generated locally by vendor software.

The toolkit allows re-usable configurations to be defined for experiment metadata and local data collection, and handles metadata entry and linkage of data. LabPipe was piloted in a multi-site clinical breathomics study. LabPipe provided a consistent, controlled approach for handling metadata and experimental data collection, collation and linkage in the exemplar study and was flexible enough to deal effectively with different data handling challenges.},

  abstract = {Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous applications in (e.g.,) machine learning and data mining. Recent studies show that graph-based ANN methods often outperform other types of ANN algorithms. For typical graph-based methods, the searching algorithm is executed iteratively and the execution dependency prohibits GPU adaptations. In this paper, we present a novel framework that decouples the searching on graph algorithm into 3 stages, in order to parallel the performance-crucial distance computation. Furthermore, to obtain better parallelism on GPU, we propose novel ANN-specific optimization methods that eliminate dynamic GPU memory allocations and trade computations for less GPU memory consumption. The proposed system is empirically compared against HNSW--the state-of-the-art ANN method on CPU--and Faiss--the popular GPU-accelerated ANN platform--on 6 datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness: SONG has around 50-180x speedup compared with single-thread HNSW, while it substantially outperforms Faiss.},

  abstract = {The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has revolutionized transcriptomic studies. However, large-scale integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a challenge largely due to unwanted batch effects and the limited transferabilty, interpretability, and scalability of the existing computational methods. We present single-cell Embedded Topic Model (scETM). Our key contribution is the utilization of a transferable neural-network-based encoder while having an interpretable linear decoder via a matrix tri-factorization. In particular, scETM simultaneously learns an encoder network to infer cell type mixture and a set of highly interpretable gene embeddings, topic embeddings, and batch-effect linear intercepts from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. scETM is scalable to over 106 cells and confers remarkable cross-tissue and cross-species zero-shot transfer-learning performance. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we find that scETM-learned topics are enriched in biologically meaningful and disease-related pathways. Lastly, scETM enables the incorporation of known gene sets into the gene embeddings, thereby directly learning the associations between pathways and topics via the topic embeddings.},

  abstract = {Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5\% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5\% and total training memory by 63.3\%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.},

  abstract = {Representation learning models have become a mainstay of modern genomics. These models are trained to yield vector representations, or embeddings, of various biological entities, such as cells, genes, individuals, or genomic regions. Recent applications of unsupervised embedding approaches have been shown to learn relationships among genomic regions that define functional elements in a genome. Unsupervised representation learning of genomic regions is free of the supervision from curated metadata and can condense rich biological knowledge from publicly available data to region embeddings. However, there exists no method for evaluating the quality of these embeddings in the absence of metadata, making it difficult to assess the reliability of analyses based on the embeddings, and to tune model training to yield optimal results. To bridge this gap, we propose four evaluation metrics: the cluster tendency score (CTS), the reconstruction score (RCS), the genome distance scaling score (GDSS), and the neighborhood preserving score (NPS). The CTS and RCS statistically quantify how well region embeddings can be clustered and how well the embeddings preserve information in training data. The GDSS and NPS exploit the biological tendency of regions close in genomic space to have similar biological functions; they measure how much such information is captured by individual region embeddings in a set. We demonstrate the utility of these statistical and biological scores for evaluating unsupervised genomic region embeddings and provide guidelines for learning reliable embeddings.}

  abstract = {During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape. In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from~the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development., Analysis of chromatin state at a single-cell level in samples of developing human forebrain demonstrate both cell-type-specific and region-specific changes during neurogenesis.},
